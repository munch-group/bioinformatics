The reason is that a text editor made for programming, such as VScode, only saves the actual characters you type. So unlike, Word, it does not silently save all kinds of formatting, like margins, bold face text, headers, etc. With VScode, what you type is exactly what ends up in the file when you save it. In addition, where Word is made for prose, VScode is made for programming and has a lot of features that you will make your programming life easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Visual Studio Code (VScode)",

    "section": "The terminal",
    "text": "The terminal\nThe last thing you need is a tool to make Python run the programs you write. Fortunately, that is already installed. On OSX this is an application called Terminal. You can find it by typing “Terminal” in Spotlight Search. When you start you will see semething like Figure 2.2. You may be presented with the following text:\nThe default interactive shell is now zsh.\nTo update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.\nFor more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: The Terminal app on Mac\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Anaconda Powershell Prompt app on Windows\n\n\n\nDo not update your account after you install Anaconda (see below). If you do, Terminal will not be able to find the Anaconda Python (If you did so by mistake anyway, you change back using this command: chsh -s /bin/bash.\nOn Windows the tool you need is called the Anaconda Powershell Prompt and was installed along with Anaconda Python. You should be able to find it from Start menu. Make sure you open Anaconda Powershell Prompt and not Anaconda Powershell Prompt. They are different programs. If you open Anaconda Powershell Prompt you should see something like Figure 2.3.\nWhat is Anaconda Powershell Prompt and this Terminal thing, you ask. Both programs are what we call terminal emulators. They are programs used to run other programs, like the ones you are going to write yourself. I will informally refer to both Terminal and Anaconda Powershell Prompt as “the terminal” So if I write something like “open the terminal”, you should open Anaconda Powershell Prompt if you are running Windows and the Terminal application if you are running OS X.\nThe terminal is a very useful tool. To use it, howevever, you need to know a few basics. First of all, a terminal lets you execute commands on your computer. You simply type the command you want and then hit enter. The place where you type is called a prompt (or command promt) and it may look a little different depending on which terminal emulator you use. In this book we represent the prompt with the character $. So a command in the examples below is the line of text to the left of the $. When you open the terminal you’ll be located in a folder. You can see which folder you are in by typing pwd, and then press Enter on the keyboard. When you press Enter you tell the terminal to execute the command you just wrote. In this case, the command you typed simply tells you the path to the folder we are in. If I do it I get:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ pwd\n/Users/kasper/programming\n\nIf I had been on a windows machine it would have looked something like:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ cd\nC:\\Users\\kasper\\programming\n\nSo right now I am in the folder programming. /Users/kasper/programming is the path or “full address” of the folder with dashes (or backslashes on windows) separating nested folders. So programming is a subfolder of kasper which is a subfolder of Users. That way you not only know which folder you are in but also where that folder is. Let us see what is in this folder. You can use the ls command (l as in Lima and s as in Sierra). When I do that and press Enter I get:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ ls\nnotes projects\n\nIt seems that there are two other folders, one called notes and another called projects. If you are curious about what is inside the notes folder, you can “walk” into the folder with the cd command. To use this command you must specify which folder you want to walk into (in this case notes). We do this by typing cd, then a space and the then name of the folder. When I press enter I get:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ cd notes\n$\n\nIt seems that nothing really happened, but if I run the pwd command now to see which folder I am in, I get:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ pwd\n/Users/kasper/programming/notes\n\nJust to keep track of what is happening: before we ran the cd command we were in the directory /Users/kasper/programming folder, and now we’re in /Users/kasper/programming/notes. This means that we can now use the ls command to see what is in the notes folder:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ ls\n$\n\nAgain it seems like nothing happened. Well, ls and dir do not show anything if the folder we are in is empty. So notes must be empty. Let us go back to where we came from. To walk “back” or “up” to /Users/kasper/programming we again use the cd command, but this time we do not need to name a folder. Instead, we use the special name .. to say that we wish to go to the parent folder called programming, i.e. the folder we just came from:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ cd ..\n$ pwd\n/Users/kasper/programming\n\nNow when we run the pwd command we see that we are back where we started. Let us see if the two folders are still there:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n$ ls\nnotes projects\n\nThey are!\nHopefully, you are now able to use navigate your folders and see what is in them. You will need this later to go to the folders with the code you write for the exercises and projects during the course.\n\n\n\nAction\nOSX\n\n\n\n\nShow current folder\npwd\n\n\nList folder content\nls\n\n\nGo to subfolder “notes”\ncd notes\n\n\nGo to parent folder\ncd ..",

    "text": "Create a conda envirionment for the course\nIn bioinformatics, we install packages and programs so we can use them in our analyses and pipelines. Sometimes, however, the versions of packages you need for one project conflicts with the versions you need for other projects that you work on in parallel. Such conflicts seem like an unsolvable problem. Would it not be fantastic if you could create a small insulated world for each project, which then only contained the packages you needed for that particular project?. If each project had its own isolated world, then there would be no such version conflicts. Fortunately, there is a tool that lets you do just that, and its name is Conda.\n\nConda is an open source package management system and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and switching easily between them.\n\nThe small worlds that Conda creates are called “environments”. You can create as many environments as you like, and then use each one for a separate bioinformatics project, a course, a bachelor project, or whatever you would like to insulate from everything else. Conda also downloads and installs the packages for you and it makes sure that the software packages you install in each environment are compatible. It even makes sure that packages needed by packages (dependencies) are also installed. Conda is truly awesome.\nWhen you install Anaconda, Conda makes a single base environment for you. It is called “base” and this is why it says “(base)” on your terminal.\nIn this course, you need to install programs, and python libraries that could conflict with the packages you need for other courses or future projects. So we will create an isolated Conda environment for Bioinformatics and Programming to avoid such conflicts. Conda is a program you run from the command line, just like python or cd. So open your terminal (i.e., the “Terminal” program if you are on a Mac and the “Anaconda Powershell Prompt” program if you are on Windows). Now copy/paste these command lines into the terminal one at a time and press return (enter) after pasting each one:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nconda create -y -n bioprog\nconda activate bioprog\nconda config --env --add channels conda-forge\nconda config --env --add channels sepandhaghighi\nconda config --env --add channels kaspermunch\nconda install -y 'python=3.9' pygments textual rich art bp-help\n\nThis commands run the Conda program and tells it to create a new environment with name “bioprog” and to install the packages we need in that environment. Once you hit enter on the last command, Conda works for some time and then writes a long list of packages in your terminal. These are all the packages and dependencies required in versions that all fit together.\nNotice how the command prompt changed from “(base)” to “(bioprog)” to show that you are now in the bioprog environment. Looks like nothing changed, but now you have access to terminal commands not available in the base envirionment. You will learn about these later. Try this command:\nconda deactivate\nNotice how it now again says “(base)” on your command prompt. That is because you are back in your base environment. Every time you start a new terminal window, you will need to run conda activate bioprog to activate the environment to be able to access the course tools.",

It is called “base” and this is why it says “(base)” on your terminal.\nMany of you take the course “Biomolecular Structure and Function” (let us call that BSF) alongside this course. In BSF, you need to install programs (e.g. PyMol) that may conflict with the packages you need for Bioinformatics and Programming. So we will create isolated Conda environments for each course to avoid such conflicts. Conda is a program you run from the command line, just like python or cd. So open your terminal (i.e., the “Terminal” program if you are on a Mac and the “Anaconda Powershell Prompt” program if you are on Windows). You need to two different set of commands depending on what chip set your computer has. If you have a new Mac it may have the new M1 or M2 chips. If you click the top left apple icon and select “About This Mac”, it will say “Apple M1” or “Apple M2” if it is.\nIf your Mac is an M1/M2 Mac, you create a conda environment for BSF by copy/pasteing these command lines into the terminal one at a time and press return (enter) after pasting each one:\nOtherwise, you create a conda environment for BSF by copy/pasteing these command lines into the terminal one at a time and press return (enter) after pasting each one:\nNotice how the command prompt changed from “(base)” to “(bioprog)” to show that you are now in the bioprog environment. Looks like nothing changed, but now you have access to terminal commands not available in the base envirionment. You will learn about these later. Try this command:\nNotice how it now again says “(base)” on your command prompt. That is because you are back in your base environment. Every time you start a new terminal window, you will need to run conda activate BSF to activate the BSF environment to be able to access pymol. Try it out:\nand press enter. Voila, you are now back in the BSF environment. Notice how the command prompt changed from “(base)” to “(BSF)” to show that you are now in the BSF environment. To run PyMol that you installed in this environment, just type\nand hit enter.\nNow try to close PyMol. Then go back to your terminal and type\nNotice how it now again says “(base)” on your command prompt. That is because you are back in your base environment. Try to type pymol (and hit enter), you terminal will tell you that it could not find anything called pymol. This is the way it should be.

    "text": "Hello World\nDive in and make your first program. Begin by creating a new file in your editor (VScode) and save it as hello.py. The .py suffix tells your editor that this file contains Python code. As you will see, this makes your life a whole lot easier. Such a file with Python code is usually called a script, but we can also call it a program.\nNow write exactly this in the file (hello.py):\nYour editor will color your code a little differently, but that is not important. Save your file with the added code, and you have your first program! Of course, there is not much point in having a program if it just sits there on your computer. To run your program, do the following:\nYou should see something like Figure 4.1.\nThis is where you shout “it’s alive!”, toss your head back and do the insane scientist laugh.\nOkay, what just happened? You wrote a program by creating a file in which you wrote one line of code. You then ran the program using Python and it wrote (printed) Hello world in the terminal. Do not worry about the parentheses and quotes for now and just enjoy your new life as a programmer.\nMaybe you wonder why we write print and not write or something else? That actually goes all the way back to the days when computers were big clunky things with no screens attached. They could only interact with the user by printing out things on a real physical paper printer. Back then, the output you now see on the screen was printed onto a piece of paper that the programmer could then look at. These days print shows up in the terminal, but the story should help you remember that print spits text out of your program just like a printer.\nNow try to add another line of code like this:\nSave the file and run it again by typing python hello.py in your terminal and hit Enter.\nYou should see this:\nNow your program first prints Hello world and then it prints I am your first program. The then-part is important. That is how a Python program works. Python (the python you write in front of hello.py) reads your hello.py file and then executes the code, one line after another until it reaches the end of the file.\nThis is essential, so read that paragraph again. Now read it once more. It may seem trivial, but it is absolutely fundamental always to remember that this is how Python runs your code. So here is oath 2:\nWhen you write Python code, you always follow this workflow:\nMake sure you get the hang of this in the following exercises.\nImportant: The examples and exercises in this course are designed to work if you execute your scripts from the folder they are stored in. So you must navigate into the relevant folder before you execute your script. If your script is called hello.py, you must always execute it exactly like this: python hello.py. On some computers it is possible to just type hello.py without python in front of it. Do not do that. Also, do not “drag” the script file into the Terminal either.",

If you write something that does not conform to the proper syntax for Python code then you will get a SyntaxError. Python will do its best to figure out where the problem is and point to it with a ^ character.\nYou will see many such error messages in your new life as a programmer. So it is important that you practice reading them. At first, they will be hard to decipher, but once you get used to them, they will help you quickly identify where the problem is. If there is an error message that you do not understand the internet is your friend. Just paste the error message into Google’s search field, and you will see that you are not the only one out there getting started on Python programming. It is okay if you do not know how to fix the problem right now, but it is essential to remember that these error messages are Pythons way of helping you understand what you did wrong.\n\nExercise 4-4\nTry to break your new shiny program and make it produce an error message when you run it. An easy way of doing this is to remove or change random characters from the program. If you run this (with a missing end-parenthesis:\nprint(\"Hello world\"\nprint(\"I am your first program\")\nYou will get this error\n  File \"hello.py\", line 2\n    print(\"I am your first program\")\n        ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\nThe ^ character tells you when your code stopped making sense to Python. Some times that is a bit after where you made your mistake.\nTry to make other kinds of errors. Which error messages do you see? Do you see the same error message every time, or are they different? Try googling the error messages you get. Can you figure out why the change you made broke the program? How many different error messages can you produce?",

A string is simply a piece of text, but we call it a string because it is a “string of characters”. In Python, we represent a string like this:\n\"this is a string\"\nor like this:\n'Hello world'\nThat is, we take the text we wish to use as our value, and we put quotes around it. We are allowed to use either double quotes (the first example) or single quotes (the second example). We can mix them like this:\nprint('this is \"some text\" with a quotes')\n– but not like this:\nprint(\"this is a broken string')\nCan you see why, and how it is handy to have both single and double quotes? Well, if we did not have both, we could not have text with quotes in it. You just need to remember to use the same kind of quotes at each end of the string. Running the latter example gives an error message telling you that Python cannot find the quote that was supposed to end the string:\n  File \"broken.py\", line 1\n    print(\"this is a broken string')\n                                   ^\nSyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal\nIt is Python’s way of saying: “I got to the end of the line (EOL) without finding an matching end quote”.",

That operator is called in. One use of it is to to test if one string is part of another string. Try this to figure out how it works:\nprint(\"Hell\" in \"Hello world\")\nprint(\"Hello world\" in \"Hello world\")\nprint(\"Hello world\" in \"Hell\")\nprint(\"lo wo\" in \"Hello world\")\nprint(\"Artichoke\" in \"Hello world\")\n\n\nExercise 5-3\nSay the supermarket has chocolate bars for 7 kr.

Google it you do not remember what it does. How about integer division. Explain both to a fellow student (or to yourself out loud).\n\n\nExercise 5-5\nYou obviously cannot go buy 4.3 chocolate bars in a store. You will have to settle for 4. Can you change the program you made in Section 5.0.0.3 to print the number of bars you can actually buy, and the change you then have left? Use the modulo and integer division operators.

The Pythagorean theorem looks like this: \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Here \\(c\\) is the length of the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lengths of the two legs of the triangle. So if we have a triangle where \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 2\\) and we want to find \\(c^2\\) we can do this in Python:\nprint(\"The squared length of the hypotenuse is:\", 5**2 + 2**2)\n\n\nExercise 5-8\nHowever, we are rarely interested in the squared length of the hypotenuse. Can you modify the code you wrote in Section 5.0.0.7 so you compute \\(c\\) instead of \\(c^2\\)? Taking the square root of a number is the same as taking that number and exponentiating it to 0.5, so the square root of \\(x\\) is \\(x^{0.5}\\). Do you know of a Python operator that does exponentiation?",

There are three additional operators that lets you express more elaborate “True/False” statements than with the comparison operators alone. These are the logical operators: and, or and not.\n\nExercise 5-9\nGo through the code below and see if you can figure out what each line does. Then write the code into your editor and run it to see what actually happens.\nprint(2 &lt; 3)\nprint(10 &lt; 12)\nprint(8 &gt; 100)\nprint(2 &lt; 3 and 10 &lt; 12)\nprint(8 &gt; 100 and 2 &lt; 3)\nprint(8 &gt; 100 or 2 &lt; 3)\nprint(not 8 &gt; 100 and 2 &lt; 3)\nprint(not 8 &gt; 100 and not 2 &gt; 3)\nDid it do what you expected? Can you explain each line?\n\n\nExercise 5-10\nWhen exposed to the operators and, or and not, some values are considered true and others are considered false. What happens when you put not in front of someting that is considered true or false? Decide what you think and why before you write the code and try it out.\nprint(not True)\nprint(not False)\nprint(not 0)\nprint(not -4)\nprint(not 0.0000000)\nprint(not 3.14159265359)\nprint(not \"apple\")\nprint(not \"\")\nFrom the code above, try to find out which values Python considers true and which it considers false. Can you come up with a rule?\n\n\nExercise 5-11\nThe logical operator and takes two values (the one to the left of the operator and the one to the right) and figures out whether both the left and the right expression is true. It actually boils down to this:\n\n\n\nLeft expression\n Right expression\n Result\n\n\n\n\nTrue\nTrue\n True\n\n\nTrue\n False\n False\n\n\nFalse\n True\n False\n\n\nFalse\nFalse\n False\n\n\n\nWrite some code to confirm that the table above is correct using Python. For example, to test the first case, do this:\nprint(True and True)\n\n\nExercise 5-12\nPython will not do any more work than absolutely necessary to find out if a logical expression is true or not. That means that, if the value left of and is considered false by Python, then there is no reason look at the right value, since it is already established that they are not both considered true. In this case the expression reduces to the left value. I.e. False and True reduces to False.\nIf the value left of and is considered true by Python, then Python needs to look at the right value too to establish if they are both considered true. In this case the expression reduces to the value on the right. I.e. True and False reduces to False.\nA rule-of-thumb is that the whole expression reduces to the last value that Python needs to consider to decide if the whole expression is true or flase. Use that rationale to explain to yourself how the two last combinations in Section 5.0.0.11 are evaluated.\n\n\nExercise 5-13\nLike the and operator, the or operator also takes two values. However, the or operator tries to figure out whether one of the two values are true. Thus, the or operator boils down to this:\n\n\n\nLeft expression\n Right expression\n Result\n\n\n\n\nTrue\nTrue\n True\n\n\nTrue\n False\n True\n\n\nFalse\n True\n True\n\n\nFalse\nFalse\n False\n\n\n\nWrite some code to confirm that the table above is correct using Python. For example, to test the first case, do this:\nprint(True or True)\n\n\nExercise 5-14\nAs with the and operator, Python will not do any more work than absolutely necessary when evaluating an expression with ‘or’. So if the value left of or is considered true by Python, then there is no reason look at the right value, since it is already established that at least one of them are considered true. In this case the expression reduces to the left value. I.e. True or False reduces to True.\nIf the value left of or is considered false by Python, then Python stil needs to look at the right value to establish if at least one of them are considered true. In this case the expression reduces to the right value. I.e. False or True reduces to True.\nAgain, the whole expression reduces to the last value that Python needs to consider to decide if the whole expression is true or flase. Use that same rationale to explain to yourself how the two last combinations in Section 5.0.0.13 are evaluated.\n\n\nExercise 5-15\nRemember what you learned in Section 5.0.0.10 about which values are considered true and which are considered false. Combine that with what you learned in Section 5.0.0.11 and Section 5.0.0.13 about what logical expressions reduce to and see if you can figure out what is printed below and why. Use the rule-of-thumb from Section 5.0.0.14. Decide what you think before you write the code and try it out.\nprint(True and 4)\nprint(0 and 7)\nprint(-27 and 0.5)\nprint(42 and 0)\nprint(\"apple\" and \"orange\")\nprint(\"apple\" and \"\")\nprint(42 or 0)\nprint(\"apple\" and \"\")\nprint(\"apple\" or \"\")\nIf you where surprised what was printed, maybe go back and have a look at Section 5.0.0.11 and Section 5.0.0.13 again.\n\n\nExercise 5-16\nRecall the in operator from Section 5.0.0.2? There is also an operator called not in. I guess you can imagine what that tests. Try it out.",

    "text": "Variables\n\nBy now you probably feel the first signs of brain-overload. If you do not take breaks, your brain may overheat and explode - we have seen that happen. One of the nice things about the brain is that it works when you rest. Archiving and understanding a lot of new information takes time, and force-feeding your brain will not help. The last part of this chapter is very important so now might be a good time for a good long break.\n\nThis section is about variables and this is where the fun begins. A variable is basically a way of assigning a name to a value. 8700000 is just a value, but if we assign a name to it then it gets a special meaning:\nnumber_of_species = 8700000\nprint(number_of_species)\nIn this case, the variable number_of_species represents the estimated number of eukaryotic species on the planet, which is 8700000. So 8700000 is the value and “number_of_species” is the variable name. Write the code above into a file and run it. Notice how this lets us refer to the value using the variable name. What appears in the terminal when you do that? do you see number_of_species or 8700000?\nAs you can see in the small program above, one of two different things happens when a variable name appears in Python code:\n\nAssignment: When a variable name appears to the left of an equals sign, then a value is assigned to the variable. This is what happens in the first line where number_of_species is assigned the value 8700000.\nSubstitution: In all other contexts, the variable is substituted for its value. This is what happens in the second line where Python substitutes the variable name number_of_species for its value 8700000 and then prints that.\n\nThat is basically it, but let us take the example a bit further and create another variable that we assign the value 1200000 to. That is the number of species discovered so far. Now, lets add this to the program and use it to compute the number of species we have yet to identify. Start by reading the code below super carefully. Remember that a variable is either assigned a value or substituted for the value it represents. For each occurrence of the variables below, determine if they are being assigned a value or if they are substituted for their value.\nnumber_of_species = 8700000\nnumber_discovered = 1200000\nnumber_unidentified = number_of_species - number_discovered\nprint(number_unidentified)\nNow write the code into a file and run it. Take some time to let it sink in that variables are extremely useful for two reasons:\n\nVariables give meaning to a value. Without the variable name, the value 1200000 could just as well be the number of people that lives in Copenhagen. However, by giving the value a meaningful name, it becomes clear what the value is meant to represent.\nWe can assign new values to variables (that is why they are called variables). That way we can change the value of number_discovered as new species are discovered.\n\nYour variable names can be pretty much anything, but they have to start with a letter or an underscore (_) and the rest of the name has to be either letters, numbers or underscores. Just to be clear: a space is not any of those things, so do not use spaces in variable names. Above all, be careful in your choice of variable names. Variable names are case sensitive, meaning that count and Count are two different variables. Stick to lower case variable names. That makes your code easier to read.\n\nExercise 5-17\nFor each occurrence of the variables below, determine if they are being assigned a value or if they are substituted for their value.\nbreeding_birds = 4\nprint(breeding_birds)\nbreeding_birds = 5\nprint(breeding_birds)\n\n\nExercise 5-18\nFor each occurrence of the variables below, determine if they are being assigned a value or if they are substituted for their value.\nbreeding_birds = 4\nprint(breeding_birds)\nbreeding_birds = breeding_birds + 1\nprint(breeding_birds)\n\n\nExercise 5-19\nWhat happens if you take the first example in this section swap the two lines? So going from this:\nnumber_of_species = 8700000\nprint(number_of_species)\nto this:\nprint(number_of_species)\nnumber_of_species = 8700000\nExplain to yourself what happens in each line of each version of the program. What kind of error do you get with version two and why? Remember Oath 2!\n\n\nExercise 5-20\nWrite the following code in a file, save it and run it.\nincome = 45000\ntaxpercentage = 0.43\ntax_amount = tax_percentage * income\nincome_after_tax = income - tax_amount\nprint('Income after tax is', income_after_tax)\nYou should get an error that looks at lot like this one:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"tax.py\", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;\n    tax_amount = tax_percentage * income\nNameError: name 'tax_percentage' is not defined\nIt says that the error is on line 3. Can you figure out what is wrong? Hopefully, you will now appreciate how much attention to detail is required when programming. Every tiny, little symbol or character in your code is essential.",

    "section": "Different types of values",
    "text": "Different types of values\nBy now you probably have a pretty good idea about what a value in Python is. So far you have seen text like 'Banana', integers like 7 and numbers with a fractional part like 4.25.\nIn Python, a text value is a type of value called a string which Python denotes str (abbreviation for “string”). So 'Banana' is a string, and so is 'Banana split'. There are two types of numbers in Python. Integers (like 7, 42, and 3) are called int. Numbers with a fractional part (like 3.1254 and 4.0) are that are called float (abbreviation for “floating-point number”).\nAs I mentioned earlier, True and False are Python values too. They are called booleans or bool, named after an English mathematician called George Boole famous for his work on logic.\nSo the different types of values we know so far are:\n\n\n\nName\nType in Python\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nString\nstr\n\"hello\", '9'\n\n\nInteger\nint\n0, 2721, 9\n\n\nFloating-point\nfloat\n1.0, 4.4322\n\n\nBoolean\nbool\nTrue, False\n\n\nNone\nNoneType\nNone\n\n\n\nIn case you did not notice, I added a special type at the end that can only have the value None. I may sound a little weird, but in programming, we sometimes need a value that represents nothing, or None. For now, just make a mental note that None is also a Python value.\nWhen you do computations in Python it is no problem to mix integers and floating-point numbers. Try this:\nprint(\"What is 0.5 * 2?\", 0.5 * 2)\nprint(\"What is 3 / 2?\", 3 / 2)\nAs you can see we can also make computations using only integers that result in floating-point numbers.\nSome of the math operators not only work on numbers, they also work on strings. That way you can add two strings together. It is no longer math of course - but quite handy.\nfruit = 'Ba' + 'na' + 'na'\nprint(fruit)\n\nExercise 5-21\nIf you try to combine different types of values in ways that are not allowed in Python, you will get an error. Try each of the following weird calculations in turn, and read the each error message carefully.\nx = 3 - '1.5'\nprint(x)\nx = None - 4\nprint(x)\n\n\nExercise 5-22\nWrite these two examples and compare the resulting values of x\nx = '9' + '4'\nprint(x)\nx = 9 + 4\nprint(x)\n\n\nExercise 5-23\nTry these two examples. What happens in each case? Does it make sense?\nx = '72' * 3\nx = '72' * '3'\n\n\nExercise 5-24\nWill this work? Use what you have learned from the other exercises and try to predict what will happen here. Then write the code and try it out.\nx = 'Ba' + 'na' * 2\nprint(x)\n\n\nExercise 5-25\nSometimes you may need to change a string to a number. You can do that like this:\nsome_value = \"42\"\nother_value = int(some_value)\nWrite some code that converts strings to numbers and numbers to strings. Remember that numeric values are either integers or floats. Use int, float as in the example above. You will notice that only meaningful conversions work. E.g. this will not work: number = int('four'). To convert a number to a string you can use str\nHaving completed the above exercises you should take note of the following four important points:\n\nAll Python values have a type. So far you know about strings, integers, floating-points, and booleans.\nMath operators let you do cool things like concatenating two strings by adding them together.\nThe flip side of that cool coin is that Python will assume you know what you are doing if you add two strings ('4' + '4' is '44' not 8) or multiply a string with an integer ('4' * 4 is '4444' not 16).\nYou can change the type of a value. E.g '4' to 4 or 1 to 1.0.\nPython will throw a TypeError if you try to combine types values of values in ways that are not allowed.\n\n\nEscape characters: An escape character is a backslash \\ followed by a single character. In Python, the most commonly used ones are \\n and \\t.\n\n\n\nExercise 5-26\nWhat do you think is printed here?\nmain_course = 'Duck a la Banana\\n'\ndessert = 'Banana split\\n'\nmenu = main_course + dessert\nprint(menu)\nCan you figure out what the special character \\n represents?\n\n\nExercise 5-27\nWhat do you think is printed here?\n\ndish_one = 'Banana\\t\\tsplit'\ndish_two = 'Chocolate\\tcake'\nprint(dish_one)\nprint(dish_two)\nCan you figure out what the special character \\t represents?",

    "text": "Precedence of Operators\nFear not. Precedence is just a nasty word for something we have already talked about. Precedence simply specifies that some things are done before other things – or more correctly, that some operations are performed before others. You already know that multiplication is done before addition. Another way of saying that is that multiplication takes precedence over addition. The expression below obviously reduces to 7 in two steps:\n\\[ 1 + 3 * 2 \\]\nFirst, \\(3 * 2\\) reduces to 6 and then \\(1 + 6\\) reduces to 7. If we wanted to add 1 and 3 first we would need to enforce this by adding parentheses:\n\\[ (1 + 3) * 2 \\]\nThis is because the multiplication operator (*) has higher precedence than the addition operator (+). Here is the list of the most common operators and their precedence in Python:\nSometimes a statement contains adjacent operators with the same precedence. In this case Python evaluates the expression left to right. I.e. This following expression first reduces to \\(0.5 * 2\\) and then to \\(1\\)\nThe following one first reduces to \\(1 * 4\\) and then to \\(4\\):\nIf you want Python order the oprations in any other way, you need to use perentheses (E.g. 2 / (2 * 4)).",

    "text": "Statements and Expressions\nTo be able to talk concisely about programming (and to receive more useful help from your instructors) you need a bit of vocabulary. Statements and expressions are two such words that you need to know. Distinguishing between statements and expressions will help us talk about the code we write.\n\nA statement is a line of code that performs an action. Python evaluates each statement in turn until it reaches the end of the file (remember oath 2?). print(y * 7) is a statement and so is x = 14. They each represent a full line of code and they each perform an action.\nAn expression is any piece of code that reduces to one value. y * 7 is an expression and so is y * 7 + 14 - x and 4 &gt; 5.\n\nWe will talk more about how expressions are handled by Python in the next section, but right now it is important that you understand that statements do something while expressions are things that reduces to a value. Hopefully, this distinction will be clearer when you have completed the following exercises.\n\nExercise 6-5\nDid you notice in the above examples that print(y * 7) is a statement and y * 7 is an expression? Yes, expressions can be part of statements. In fact they most often are. Similarly, expressions are often made up of other smaller expressions. E.g. y * 7 is part of the larger expression y * 7 + 14 - x.\nTake a look at this code:\nx = 5\ny = 20\nz = (x + y) / 2 + 20\nprint(z * 2 + 1)\nh = 2 * x - 9 * 48\nprint(h)\nWrite down the code on a piece of paper. Now mark all statements and all expressions. Remember that expression are often made up of smaller expressions, so you can find a lot of them. E.g. (x + y), 2 + 20, and (x + y) / 2 + 20 are all expressions. In fact, a single variable (like x) is also a small expression. Discuss with a fellow student. Do you agree on what find?\n\n\nExercise 6-6\nConsider the following code:\ngreeting = 'Hello' + ' my '\nprint(greeting + 'friend')\nHow many statements are there in this piece of code?

    "section": "Substitution and Reduction",
    "text": "Substitution and Reduction\nAlthough substitution and reduction may not sound like your new best friends, they truly are! If you remember to think about your Python code in terms of substitution and reduction, then programming will make a lot of sense. Understanding and using these simple rules you will allow to read and understand any code. If you do not, you may get by for a while - only to find yourself in big big trouble later when things start to become more complicated.\nYou should remember, from the section on variables in the previous chapter, that variables in Python in are either assigned a value or substituted for the value they represent.\nIn the first two lines of code below, the variables x and y are each assigned a value. Now consider the last line in the example:\nx = 4\ny = 3\nz = x * y + 8\nHere x is substituted by the value 4 and y is substituted by the value 3. So now the expression after the equals sign reads 4 * 3 + 8. Because we multiply before we add, 4 * 3 reduces to 12 so that the expression now reads 12 + 8. Finally, this reduces to the value 20. The very last thing that happens is that the variable z is assigned the value 20.\nYou should do these steps every time you see an expression. You may think that this is overdoing things a bit, but it is not. This kind of explicit thinking is what programming is all about and it will become increasingly important as the course progresses. So make sure you make it a habit while it still seems trivial. Then, over time, it will become second nature.\nNow raise your right hand and read the third and last oath out loud:\n\nOath 3: I hereby solemnly swear to consciously consider every single substitution and reduction in every Python expression that I read or write from this moment on.\n\nThis was the last of the three oaths but it is by far the most important one. You can take your hand down now.\nNB: You may not realize at this point, but the last two subsections are the most important ones in the book. Go back and read them many times as you proceed through the course. If you explicitly think in terms of substitution and reduction you will have no trouble. If you do not, you are entering a mine field with snowshoes on.\n\nExercise 6-7\nDo the substitution and reduction steps with pen and paper, then run it to check yourself by inserting a print statement at the end.\nx = 7\ny = 4 + x\n2 + x * x**2 + y - x\n\n\nExercise 6-8\nDo the substitution and reduction steps with pen and paper, then run it to check yourself by iserting a print statement at the end.\na = 4\nb = a\nc = 2\nc = a + b + c\n\n\nExercise 6-9\nDo the substitution and reduction steps with pen and paper, then run it to check yourself by iserting a print statement at the end.\nx = 1\nx = x\n\n\nExercise 6-10\nDo the substitution and reduction steps with pen and paper, then run it to check yourself by iserting a print statement at the end.\nmicrosatellite = \"GTC\" * 41\nSurprised?\n\n\nExercise 6-11\nDo the substitution and reduction steps with pen and paper, then run it to check yourself by iserting a print statement at the end.\nmini_gene = \"ATG\" + \"GCG\" + \"TAA\"\nWhat did you do first here?

Two of them are integers called int, and decimal numbers (or floating points) called float. When you use an operator like + or &gt; it produces a value. No matter what you put on either side of &gt; in it produces a boolean value (bool), True or False. For other operators the type of value produced depends on which values the operator works on. Try this and see if you print an integer or a float (8 or 8.0):\nx = 4\ny = 2\nresult = x * y\nprint(result)\nNow try to replace 4 with 4.0. What type is result now?. Try to also replace 2 with 2.0.

Can you extract a rule for what the * operator produces depending on the what types the two values have?\n\n\nExercise 6-32\nIn Section 6.0.0.31 you investigated what types of values the * operator produce. Redo that exercise with the operators: +, -, /, **, //, and %. What are the rules for what is returned if both values are integers, one value is a float, or both values are floats?\n\n\nExercise 6-33\nMake a list of all the operators you know so far in order of precedence (without looking in the notes). Then check yourself.\n\n\nExercise 6-34\nWhat does his expression reduce to and what type of value is it?\n3 &gt; 2\n\n\nExercise 6-35\nWhat does his expression reduce to and what type of value is it?

    "text": "Wax on, wax off\nSeeing the sequence of substitutions and reductions in a Python expression will become natural over time. Until it does, you are in troubled waters, and if you do not practice in time, you may only realize this too late. Considering how simple this is to practice and how crucial it is to your progress, I have written a small companion program called myiagi where you can train this particular skill daily. The program is installed in the conda environment you created for this source, so make sure it is activated as described. To run the program, you execute this command in the terminal:\nIt should look like Figure 7.1, and the simple game is as follows. The program generates a Python expression. From that expression, it then performs all the substitution and reduction steps. Each substitution or reduction results in an intermediate expression until only a single Python value remains. Here is an example where the expression is 4 * y + x and the value it reduces to is 37:\nYou do not know what values the y and x variables point to, but you can deduce it from the sequence of expressions that they are 24 and 13. In the game, you are given a series of numbered expressions in the wrong order like this:\nYour task is to put them in the right order so that the original expression is at the top and the single Python value it reduces to is at the bottom. Now, you might grab line 2 by tabbing 2 on your keyboard (the number turns red so you can see it is active). Then, you move the line using the up/down arrow keys. If you move it to the bottom, the list then looks like this:\nNow, you repeat this process until the order is correct (the program will let you know when it is). The fewer lines you grab to produce the right order, the more points you earn. Problems with longer lists of expressions also earn you more points. As problems become harder and include more aspects of Python, solving them also awards more points. Each week has a score goal to guide your effort. Reaching this goal ensures that you practice as much as you should. Practicing a bit every day daily is more effective than practicing a lot a few days a week. To provide an incentive, the points you earn slowly expire, so the easiest way to maintain your score is to practice a bit every day.",

Also, note that the lines below each if-statement are indented with exactly four spaces. While you write the program, try to figure out what the if-statement does. Then run the code and see what happens.\nTry to change the values of bus_seats, passengers and bags and see how execution of the program changes.\nYou have probably realized that the if-statements control which print-statements that are evaluated. A statement nested under an if-statement is only evaluated if the expression between the if keyword and the : reduces to a value Python considers as true. This does not happen if the expression between the if and : reduces to a value Python considers false.\nRemind yourself that when asked to evaluate something as true or false, Python will interpret zero and empty values (like 0 and '') as False and all other non-zero and non-empty values as True.",

That way we can write our song the way lyrics with a chorus are usually written:\nFirst, let us break down the function definition in the top part of this code:\nWhen Python runs this code, each line is executed one by one starting from the first line (remember oath two?). So in this case python first executes the definition of the chorus function. The only thing that has happened after Python has executed the first five lines of code is that it has assigned the name chorus to the four indented statements. So Python now “knows” about the chorus function (like it “knows” about a variable x after we do x = 4).\nTo use the function, we “call” it by writing its name followed by parentheses: chorus().

We call the function chorus. We could name it something else, but like good variable names, good function names can help you remember what your code does.\nAfter the name you put two parentheses, ().\nThen a colon, :.\nThe statements that are part of the function are nested under the def statement and are indented with four spaces exactly like we do under if-statements.\nThe return-statement ends the function. The expression after the return keyword reduces to a value that the function then returns.\n\n\n\n\nWhen a function is called, each statement in the definition is executed one after the other. If you look at the function definition, you can see that our chorus function has four statements.\nThe first statement assigns a string value to the variable line1.\nThe second statement assigns a string value to the variable line2.\nThe third statement assigns a string value to the variable line3.\nThe fourth statement is a return-statement. The expression after the return keyword in the final statement reduces to a value and this value is what the function call is substituted for. In this case, that value is the following string:\n\n\"La la dim du da da di\\nSkubi dubi dumdi di\\nBing di dubi dum da di\"\n\n\nA function names a piece of code (some statements) just like variables name values like strings and numbers.\nWe call a function by writing the function name followed by parentheses: chorus(). Just writing the function name will not call the function.\nWhen a function is called it is substituted by the value that the function returns – exactly like a variable in an expression is substituted by its value. It is absolutely crucial that you remember this.\n\n\nExercise 9-1\nNow that we have a chorus function, that part is out of the way and we can concentrate on our song without having to worry about remembering how many “la la”s it has and so on. Try to change the “lyrics” in the chorus a little bit. Notice how you only need to make the change in one place to change all the choruses in the song – cool right? Without the function, you would have to rely on correctly changing the code in many different places.\n\n\nExercise 9-2\nTry to delete the return-statement in the chorus function (the last line in the function) and run the code again. You should see something like this:\nFunctions are super, Functions are cool\nWhen writing a program they are a great tool\nNone\nFunctions are used to wrap up some code\nThey are not so strange that your head will explode\nNone\nIt seems that the function call (chorus()) is now substituted with None. How can that be when we did not return anything? The reason is that when you do not specify a return statement the function returns None by default. This is to honour the rule that variables and a function calls are substituted by a value, and None is simply the value that Python uses to represent “nothing”. None is basically a value denoting the lack of value. As you just saw it is used to represent that no value is returned from a function. It can also be assigned to a variable as a placeholder value until another value is assigned:\nx = None\nx = 4\nAlso, None is considered false in a logical context:\nprint(not None)\n\n\nExercise 9-3\nTry this variant to the chorus function. Go through the code slowly and repeat all the steps in the breakdown of what happens when a function is called. Remember to also do each substitution and reduction carefully.\ndef chorus():\n    line1 = 'La la'\n    line2 = 'Du bi du'\n    return line1 + '\\n' + line2\nDo the same for this variant:\ndef chorus():\n    line1 = 'La la'\n    line2 = 'Du bi du'\n    chrous_text = line1 + '\\n' + line2\n    return chrorus_text\nand for this variant:\ndef chorus():\n    return \"La la\\nDu bi du\"\n\n\nExercise 9-4\nWhat do you think happens if you move the definition of chorus to the bottom of your file? Decide what you think will happen and why (maybe you remember what happens when you try to use a variable in an expression before you have defined it?). Then try it out.\nprint(\"Functions are super, Functions are cool\")\nprint(\"When writing a program they are a great tool\")\nprint( chorus() )\n\nprint(\"Functions are useful to wrap up some code\")\nprint(\"They are not so strange that your head will explode\")\nprint( chorus() )\n\ndef chorus():\n    line1 = \"La la dim du da da di\"\n    line2 = \"Skubi dubi dumdi di\"\n    line3 = \"Bing di dubi dum da di\"\n    return line1 + '\\n' + line2 + '\\n' + line3\nMake sure you understand how the error you get relates to the way Python runs your script (remember oath two?). If you still do not understand, do the next exercise and then return to this one.\n\n\nExercise 9-5\nWhich error do you get here and why? How is that similar to the the error in the previous exericse?\nprint(x)\nx = 7\n\n\nExercise 9-6\nConsider the code below. Do all the substitution and reduction steps in your head. Remember that each function call is substituted by the value that the function returns. Then run it.\ndef lucky_number():\n    return 7\n\nx = lucky_number()\ny = lucky_number()\ntwice_as_lucky = x + y\nprint(twice_as_lucky)\nNow change the code to that below. The code makes the same computation but in fewer steps. Do all the substitution and reduction steps again.\ndef lucky_number():\n    return 7\n\ntwice_as_lucky = lucky_number() + lucky_number()\nprint(twice_as_lucky)\nNow change the code to that below. The code makes the same computation but in fewer steps. Do all the substitution and reduction steps again.\ndef lucky_number():\n    return 7\n\nprint(lucky_number() + lucky_number())",

    "text": "Functions can take arguments\nThe functions we have written so far are not very flexible because they return the same thing every time they are called. Now write and run this beauty:\ndef square(number):\n    squared_number = number**2\n    return squared_number \n\nresult = square(3)\nprint(result)\nNotice how we put a variable (number) between parentheses in the function definition. This variable is assigned the value that we put between the parentheses (3) when we call the function. So when we call the function like this: square(3) – then this implicitly happens inside the function: number = 3.\nHere is another example:\ndef divide(numerator, denominator):\n    result = numerator / denominator \n    return result\n\ndivision_result = divide(44, 77)\nprint(division_result)\nWhen the function call divide(44, 77), these two things implicitly happen: numerator = 44 and denominator = 77.\nTake note of the following three important points: 1. The values that we pass to the function in the function call (like 3, 44 and 77) are called arguments. It is crucial to remember that it is values and not variables that are passed to functions. 2. The variables in the definition line of a function, like number, numerator and denominator, are called parameters. They hold the values passed to the function when it is called (the arguments). 3. You can define functions with any number of parameters as long as you use the same number of arguments when you call the function.\n\nExercise 9-7\nTry to call your divide function like this divide(77, 44). What does it return and what do you learn from that? Does the order of arguments and parameters correspond?\n\n\nExercise 9-8\nTry to call your divide function like this divide(44). Do you get an error, and what do you learn from that?\n\n\nExercise 9-9\nTry to call your divide function like this divide(44, 77, 33). Do you get a different error message, and what do you learn from that?\n\n\nExercise 9-10\nRead this code and do all substitution and reduction steps from beginning to end.\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\nresult = square(9) + square(5)\nprint(\"The result is:\", result)\nNow replace the line return x ** 2 with print(x ** 2). What is printed now? and why?\n\n\nExercise 9-11\nAs described above, a return statement ends the function by producing the value that replaces the function call. If a function has more than one return statement, then the function ends when the first one is executed.\ndef assess_number(x):\n    if x &lt; 3:\n        return 'quite a few'\n    if x &lt; 100:\n        return 'a lot'\n    return 'a whole lot'\n\nnr_apples = 2\nprint(nr_apples, \"apples is\", assess_number(nr_apples))\nWhat happens when x is 2, 3, 50, 200?

    "text": "Functions and variables\nA function call is temporary little world only exists from the function is called and until it returns its value. It did not exist before the function was called and it does not exist after the function returns its value. By necessity, the variables defined in your function are also temporary.\nThis means that variables defined inside a function are private to each function call. It also means that variables defined inside functions are not available to code outside the function. Running the following example in should help you understand this:\ndef make_greeting():\n    greeting = 'Guten tag'\n    name = 'Heinz' \n    message = greeting + \" \" + name\n    return message\n\ngreeting = 'Buongiorno'\nname = 'Giovanni'\nprint( make_greeting() )\nprint(greeting + \" \" + name)\nNotice how Heinz and Giovanni are greated in their native languages. This means that the variable definitions inside the function does not overwrite the Italian versions already defined outside the function. This is because the variables defined in the function are temporary and private to the function, even if they have the same names as variables outside the function. This is why the function call make_greeting() in the print statement does not change the values of the variables that are printed in the last line.\nNow try to “comment out” the line greeting = 'Guten tag' and run the example again. All of a sudden Heinz is greeted in Italian! The reason is that now Python cannot find a definition of greeting inside the function. It then looks outside the function for a definition and finds the Italian version.\nNow try to “comment out” the line greeting = 'Buongiorno' and run the example again. You get an error, but which one? Python complains that it cannot find a definition of greeting. The reason is that once the last print statement is executed the small world of the function call in the previous line no longer exists.\nYou should learn two rules from the above example:\n\nAll variables that you define inside a function are private to the function. If a variable in a function has the same name as a variable in the main script (like greeting above) then these are two separate variables that just happen to have the same name.\nWhen you use a variable like greeting in the function (E.g. message = greeting + \" \" + name), then Python checks if the variables have been defined in the function. If that is not the case, then it will look for it outside the function. In the above example, it finds name in the function and greeting outside the function. It is good practice to make your functions “self-contained”, in the sense that Python should not have to look outside the function for variables.\n\n\nExercise 9-12\nTry this version of the example above. Now name is defined as a function parameter, but is it still a function variable just like greeting.\ndef make_greeting(name):\n    greeting = \"Guten tag\"\n    message = greeting + \" \" + name\n    return message\n\ngreeting = 'Buongiorno'\nname = 'Giovanni'\nprint( make_greeting(\"Heinz\") )\nprint(greeting + \" \" + name)\n\n\nExercise 9-13\nConsider the following example:\ndef double(z):\n    return z * 2\n   \nx = 7\nresult = double(x)\nprint(result)\nWhen the function is called (double(x)) the x is substituted by its value 7. That value is passed as the argument and assigned to the function parameter z (z = 7). z is a private function variable and does not exist before or after the function call. Does this change in any way if we use the variable name x instead of z like below?\ndef double(x):\n    return x * 2\n   \nx = 7\nresult = double(x)\nprint(result)\nDo all substations and reductions for each line of code from top to bottom. Keep the sequence of events in mind and remember that a function definition is merely a template describing a mini-world that is created anew everytime the function is called.",

They work just like a function you would write yourself. You already know the print function quite well, and that is an example of a function that prints something but returns None. There are many other useful builtin function, but for now, I will just tell you about another two: Those are len and type.\n\nExercise 9-14\nTry these examples:\nx = 'Banana'\nprint(\"The value of variable x is of type\", type(x))\nprint(\"The value of variable x has length\", len(x))\nAs you can see, type returns the type of the value passed as the argument, and len returns the length of the value passed as the argument. The type function is handy in case you wonder what type a value has, but it is not a function we will use in this course. The len function, however, is your new best friend. You will see why soon enough.\n\n\nExercise 9-15\nTry to change the value of the x in Section 9.0.0.14 to an integer or a float and see what happens when you run it. Do you get an error?

Play around with the code for each example and see what happens if you change it a bit.\n\nExercise 9-19\nConsider this function definition that takes a single number as the argument:\ndef square(n):\n    return n**2\nWhat does it do? What does it return? What number does square(2) then represent?\nBelow I have used it in some expressions that are printed. Make sure you understand what each expression evaluates to. Do the explicit substitutions and reductions on paper before you run it. Remember that we substitute a function call (like square(2)) for the value it returns, just like we substitute a variable x for the value it points to.\nprint(square(3))\nprint(square(2 + 1))\nprint(square(2) * 2 + square(3))\nprint(square(square(2)))\nprint(square(2 * square(1) + 2))\n\n\nExercise 9-20\nWhat does this function do?

Which value does it return?\ndef power(a, b):\n    print(\"This function computes {}**{}\".format(a, b))\n    return a**b\n\nprint(power(4, 2))\nTry (possibly strange) variations of the code like the ones below to better understand the contribution of each line of code. What is the difference between return and print? What happens when the Python gets to a return statement in a function? What happens when the function does not have a return statement?\nVariation 1:\ndef power(a, b):\n    print(\"This computes\", a, \"to the power of\", b)\n    print(a**b)\n\nresult = power(4, 2)\nprint(result)\nVariation 2:\ndef power(a, b):\n    print(\"This computes\", a, \"to the power of\", b)\n    return a**b\n\nresult = power(4, 2)\nprint(result)\nVariation 3:\ndef power(a, b):\n    print(\"This computes\", a, \"to the power of\", b)\n    a**b\n\nprint(power(4, 2))\nVariation 4:\ndef power(a, b):\n    return a**b\n    print(\"This computes\", a, \"to the power of\", b)\n\nprint(power(4, 2))\n\n\nExercise 9-21\nDefine a function called diff, with two parameters, x and y. The function must return the difference between the values of x and y.\nExample:\ndef diff(x, y):\n    ...\n\ndiff(8, 2) # should return 6\ndiff(-1, 2) # should return -3\nSave the value returned from the function in a variable. Then test if the function works correctly by comparing the result to what you know is the true difference (using ==).\n\n\nExercise 9-22\nDefine a function called all_equal that takes five arguments and returns True if all five arguments have the same value and False otherwise. The function should work with any input, for example:\nall_equal(\"Can\", \"Can\", \"Can\", \"Can\", \"Can\")\nall_equal(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\nall_equal(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)\nall_equal(True, True, True, True, True)\nHint: You test equality with a == b. Now think back to what you learned about logic. Which operator can you use to test if a == b and b == c?\n\n\nExercise 9-23\nDefine a function called is_even which takes one argument and returns True if (and only if) this is an even number and False otherwise (remember the modulo operator?).\nis_even(8) # should return True\nis_even(3) # should return False\n\n\nExercise 9-24\nDefine a function called is_odd which takes one argument and returns True if (and only if) the argument is an odd number and False otherwise.\nis_odd(8) # should return False\nis_odd(3) # should return True\nCan you use the is_even you defined in Section 9.0.0.23 to complete this exercise? How? Why is that a good idea?\n\n\nExercise 9-25\nHere is a function that should return True if given an uppercase (English) vowel, and False otherwise:\ndef is_uppercase_vowel(c):\n    c == 'A' or c == 'E' or c == I or c == 'O' or c == 'U'\n    \nchar = 'A' \nif is_uppercase_vowel(char):\n    print(char, \"is an uppercase vowel\")\nelse:\n    print(char, \"is NOT an uppercase vowel\")\nNow type the code exactly as shown and run it. Do you get what you expect? Does the code work? If not, try to figure out why. Try print the value that the function returns. Does that give you any hints about the cause of the problem?\n\n\nExercise 9-26\nDefine a function called is_nucleotide_symbol which takes one argument and returns True if this is either A, C, G, T, a, c, g or t, and False in any other case.\nName your parameter something sensible like symbol.\nis_nucleotide_symbol(\"A\") # should return True\nis_nucleotide_symbol(\"B\") # should return False\nis_nucleotide_symbol(\"Mogens\") # should return False\nis_nucleotide_symbol(\"\") # should return False\n\n\nExercise 9-27\nDefine a function called is_base_pair which takes two parameters, base1, base2, and returns True if base2 is the complementary of base1, and False otherwise.\nis_base_pair(\"A\", \"G\") # should return False\nis_base_pair(\"A\", \"T\") # should return True\nis_base_pair(\"T\", \"A\") # should return True\nis_base_pair(\"Preben\", \"A\") # should return False\n\n\nExercise 9-28\nDid you find the bug in Section 9.0.0.25? You were supposed to find that the function did not have a return value. This makes the function return None by default. Do you think the None value is considered true or false in an if-statement?\n\n\nExercise 9-29\nDefine a function called celcius2fahrenheit that converts from celsius to Fahrenheit. You can do this because you know the linear relationship between the two. On Figure 9.1 you can see that the slope is 9 / 5 and the intercept is 32. The function should have one parameter celsius. Inside the function, you should define the variables slope and intercept and give them the appropriate values. Then you can calculate the conversion to Celcius using these variables and return the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Temperature conversion\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9-30\nTry to change your conversion function so it takes three arguments, corresponding to celsius, slope and intercept so you can call it like this to convert 27 degrees celsius: conversion(37, 9 / 5, 32). Now you have a function that can do any linear conversion that you can put inside another function like this:\ndef celcius2fahrenheit(celsius):\n    return conversion(celsius, 9 / 5, 32)\n\n\nExercise 9-31\nNow try to extend this to a different problem: It has been found that the height and weight of a person are related by a linear equation with slope = 0.55 and intercept = -25. Define a function called predict_weight which takes just one argument, the height of a person, and returns the estimated weight of the person.\n\n\nExercise 9-32\nBy now you know that some of the words in your code have specific purposes. def defines functions, return returns value from a function, and is a logical operator etc. Here is a list of the ones you will see in this course: and, assert, break, continue def, del, elif, else, False, for, from, if, import, in, is, not, or, pass, return, while, True, None (you can see a full list here)\nThese words are reserved for their special purposes in Python and you will not be allowed to assign values to them. Try this to see for yourself:\nNone = 4\nor this:\nand = 2\n\n\nFAQ - Frequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can function names be anything?\nA: Just about.

    "text": "Methods\nIn Python, a value like an integer or string, not only holds data. It is also packaged with a lot of useful functionality relevant to the particular type of value. When a value is packaged with such relevant functionality and meta information, programmers call it an object - and in Python all values are objects.\nThe associated functionality comes in the form of methods. You can think of methods as functions that are packaged together with the value. For example, string values have a method called capitalize. Try it out:\nTo call the method on the string value, you connect the string value and the method call with a dot. So to call a method on a value you do the following:\nYou can see that the method call looks just like a function call and in many ways calling a method works much like calling a function. The difference is that when we call a function we say: “Hey function, capitalize this string!”. When we call a method we say: “Hey string, capitalize yourself!”\nSo why do we need methods? Why do we need them when we have functions? It turns out that it is very handy to have some relevant and ready-to-use functionality packaged together with the data it works on. You will start to appreciate that sooner than you think.\nMethods are almost always used with variables. So remember to do any substitutions and reductions requried. When we put a method call after a variable like below, the variable is first substituted for its value and then the method is called on the value. Consider the second line of this example:\nHere x is first substituted by \"banana\" and then the method is called on that value, like this: \"banana\".capitalize().\nNow write and run these examples:\nYou can see what these methods do. For example: upper returns an uppercased copy of the string.",

    "section": "String formatting",
    "text": "String formatting\nYou have already tried string formatting in Section 10.0.0.1. String formatting is a simple but powerful technique that lets you generate pretty strings from pre-computed values. You may have noticed that every time we print a floating-point number, a lot of decimals are shown. Not very pretty if you are only interested in two decimals anyway. To format a string, you use the format method (surprise). In its simplest use, format replaces occurrences of {} with the arguments that is passed to it - like this:\ntaxon = \"genus:{}, species:{}\".format('Homo', 'sapiens')\n\nExercise 10-5\nWhat happens if you try this?\nquestion = \"Was {} {} Swedish?\".format('Carl', 'Linneaus')\nand this?\nquestion = \"Was {} Swedish?\".format('Carl', 'Linneaus')\nand this?\nquestion = \"Was {} {} Swedish?\".format('Carl Linneaus')\nIn the two last examples the number of {} did not match the number of arguments to format. What happens when there are too few and what happens when there are too many?\n\n\nExercise 10-6\nConsider this code:\ns = \"{} is larger than {}\".format(4, 3)\nprint(s)\nWhat will happen if you run this code? Write the code and see for yourself once you think you know. If you were wrong, make sure you understand why.\n\n\nExercise 10-7\nConsider this code:\nlanguage = 'Python'\ninvention = 'sliced bread'\ns = '{} is the best thing since {}'.format(language, invention)\nprint(s)\nWhat will happen if you run this code? Write the code and see for yourself once you think you know. If you were wrong, make sure you understand why.\n\n\nExercise 10-8\nConsider this code:\nmy_template = '{} is the best thing since {}'\nlanguage = 'Python'\nprint(my_template.format(language, 'sliced bread'))\nprint(my_template.format(language, 1900 + 89))\nWhat will happen if you run this code? Do the substitution and reduction steps in your head.\n\n\nExercise 10-9\nThink back to Section 5.0.0.3 where you calculated how many cookies you could buy for 30 kr. The bars are 7 kr. So your program looked something like this:\nnr_bars = 30 / 7\nprint('I can buy', nr_bars, 'chocolate bars!')\nand it ran like this: python chocolate.py\nI can buy 4.285714285714286 chocolate bars!\nString formatting lets you rewrite the program like this:\nnr_bars = 30 / 7\nmessage = \"I can buy {} chocolate bars!\".format(nr_bars)\nprint(message)\nTry to replace {} with {:.2f}. format reads the stuff after the colon in each set of curly brackets and uses it as directions for how to format the value it inserts. Try it out and see what happens if you change the number 2 to 3, 4, 5 or 10.\n\n\nExercise 10-10\nSee if you can find the documentation for the format function in the Python documentation. It can do wondrous things, for this course we will only try to control the number of digits and padding with spaces. Look at the examples below. Maybe you can figure out how it works\npi = 3.14159265359\nprint(\"*{}*\".format(pi))\nprint(\"*{:.3f}*\".format(pi))\nprint(\"*{:.6f}*\".format(pi))\nprint(\"*{:&gt;5.3f}*\".format(pi))\nprint(\"*{:&gt;10.3f}*\".format(pi))\n\n\nExercise 10-11\nThis is bonus info, rather than an actual exericse. How do you think python can figure out that adding strings with is supposed to work differently than adding numbers? Remember that '1' + '2' is '12' not 3. The answer is that all values you can add with the + operator has a secret method called __add__ that defines how adding works for that type of value:\ns1 = \"11\"\ns2 = \"22\"\nn1 = 11\nn2 = 22\nprint(s1 + s2)\nprint(s1.__add__(s2))\nprint(n1 + n2)\nprint(n1.__add__(n2))\nThis is one of many examples of how objects allow Python to implement functionality that fits each particular type of value. This was just to show how Python does this. Just like yellow and black stripes in nature means “don’t touch me!” – double underscores (__) is Python’s way of saying “do not use this!”. You are supposed to use the + operator not the __add__ method.",

    "section": "Indexing and slicing strings",
    "text": "Indexing and slicing strings\nAnother feature of string objects is that they allow you to extract individual parts of the string.\nEach character in a string is identified by its index in the string. To access a character in a list you write brackets after the string. Between those brackets, you specify the index of the character you want. The first character has index 0, the second has index 1 and so on.\ncodon = 'ATG'\nprint(\"first base is\", codon[0])\nprint(\"second base is\", codon[1])\nprint(\"third base is\", codon[2])\nYou may wonder why the index of the first character is zero and not one. That is simply the convention in programming and is so for good reason. Over time you will begin to find this useful rather than annoying. You should think of the index as the offset from the start of the string.\nThat also means that the index is not the length of the string, but the length minus one:\namino_acids = 'ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV'\nlast_index = len(amino_acids)-1\nprint(\"Last amino acid is\", amino_acids[last_index])\nIf you want a sub-string from a larger string (we call that a slice), you specify a start index and an end index separated by a colon:\nprint(amino_acids[1:4])\nWhen you run that you can see that amino_acids[1:4] is substituted for 'RND', so the slicing operation produces a sub-string of amino_acids. You may wonder why the value at index 4 is not in the resulting sub-string. That is another programming convention: intervals are ends exclusive. So when you specify an interval with a start index of 1 and an end index of 4 it represents all the characters starting from 1 and up to, but not including, 4. So the slice 1:4 corresponds to the characters at indexes 1, 2 and 3. The reason programmers handle intervals in this way is that it makes it easier to write clear and simple code as you will see in the exercises.\n\nExercise 10-12\nWhat do this expression reduces to?\n\"Futterwacken\"[7]\n\n\nExercise 10-13\nWhat is printed here? Do all the substitution and reduction steps and compare to the exercise above.\ns = \"Futterwacken\"\nprint(s[7])\n\n\nExercise 10-14\nWhat is printed here? Do all the substitution and reduction steps – and do it twice. Next week you will be happy you did.\ndna = 'TGAC'\ni = 0\nprint(dna[i])\ni = 1\nprint(dna[i])\ni = 2\nprint(dna[i])\n\n\nExercise 10-15\nWhat do you think happens here? Make up your mind and try out the code below:\ns = \"Futterwacken\"\ns[6] = 'W'\nDid you see that coming? Strings are immutable, which means that you cannot change them once you have made them. If you want \"FutterWacken\" you need to produce a new string with that value. Try to figure out how to do that with the replace method of strings.\n\n\nExercise 10-16\nWhen you do not specify the start and/or the end of a slice, Python will assume sensible defaults for the start and end indexes. What do you think they are? Make up your mind and try out the code below:\ns = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz'\nprint(s[:11])\nprint(s[11:])\nprint(s[:])\n\n\nExercise 10-17\nFind the documentation for how slicing of strings work.\n\n\nExercise 10-18\nWhat do you think happens when you specify an index that does not correspond to a value in the list:\nalphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz'\nprint(alphabet[99])\nRead and makek sure you understand the error message. You can try to Google the error message.\n\n\nExercise 10-19\nDo you think you also get an error when you specify a slice where the end is too high? Try it out:\nalphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz'\nprint(alphabet[13:99])\nand this:\nalphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz'\nprint(alphabet[10000:10007])\nI guess that is worth remembering, right?\n\n\nExercise 10-20\nWhich character in a string named alphabet does this expression reduce to?\nalphabet[len(alphabet)-1]\n\n\nExercise 10-21\nBecause intervals are “ends exclusive” we can compute the length of a slice as end - start:\ndna = \"ATGAGGTCAAG\"\nstart = 1\nend = 4\nprint(\"{} has length {}\".format(dna[start:end], end-start))\nFigure out what this code would look like if ends were included in intervals.\n\n\nExercise 10-22\nAnother advantage of “ends exclusive” intervals is that you only need one index to split a string in two:\ns = 'Banana'\nidx = 3\nbeginning = s[:idx]\nend = s[idx:]\nprint(beginning + end)\nFigure out what indexes you would need to use to split a sequence in two if ends were included in intervals.\n\n\nExercise 10-23\nDid you look up the details of how slicing works in Section 10.0.0.17?

    "text": "Lists\nFor many kinds of data, the order of things is important. Just like the order of characters is important for the meaning of text in a string, we sometimes we want to specify the order of other things because the relative order of items in the list has some meaning. It could be a grocery list where you have listed the things to buy in the order you get to them in the supermarket. This is where Python lists are useful. When you print a list it nicely shows all the values it contains.\nUnlike strings that can only store the order of characters, lists can contain any kind of values and you can mix different types of values any way you like. Here is a list that contains an integer, a boolean, a string and a list:\nBy now you have probably guessed that you make a list with two square brackets. Between them you can put values with commas in-between. A list is a container of other values and the value of the list itself does not depend on the values it contains. This makes sense. Otherwise, an empty list would not have a value:\nYou can add single values to the end of a list using the append method of lists. Try it out:\nIf you have a list you want to add to the end of another list you use the extend method:\nNotice how append and extend modifies the existing list instead of producing a new list with the added element.",

Do all of the substitution and reduction steps in your head, and only then try out the code.\ndonald['child'] = tiffany\nmelania['husband'] = donald\n\nprint(melania)\nprint(melania['husband']['child'])\n\n\nExercise 12-7\nA dictionary can contain any kind of Python values, even lists or dictionaries. Consider the code below where we add a list of ex-wives to the Trump persona. Can you see why we need to check if the 'ex-wives' key before we add to the list of ex-wives?\ndonald = {'name': 'Donald Trump', 'age': 70, 'job': 'President' }\n\nif 'ex-wives' not in donald:\n    donald['ex-wives'] = []\ndonald['ex-wives'].append('Marla Maples')\ndonald['ex-wives'].append('Ivana Trump')\n\nprint(donald)\n\n\nExercise 12-8\nI case you wonder what the type of value a list is, or a dictionary, try this:\nprint(\"A list has type:\", type([]))\nprint(\"A dictionary has type:\", type({}))\nNow the types list and dict are your friends too.\n\n\nExercise 12-9\nLists can also contain any kind of value. Consider this example. What do you think the following code produces? Do all the substitution and reduction steps in your head, and only then try out the code.\ntrump_family = [donald, melania, ivanka, tiffany]\nprint(trump_family)\nprint(trump_family[1]['job'])\n\n\nExercise 12-10\nWrite and run this code\namino_acids = {}\namino_acids['ATG'] = 'met'\namino_acids['TCT'] = 'ser'\namino_acids['TAC'] = 'tyr'\n\ncodon = 'TCT'\nprint(\"{} encodes {}\".format(codon, amino_acids[codon]))\n\nYou have probably noticed that, for each type of value, the interpretation of length is different. In a string it is the number of characters, in a list is the number of values in the list and in a dictionary, it is the number of key-value pairs. How do you think Python knows which interpretation of length to use when the len function is called? This is where objects shine. len(x) just returns the value that x.__len__() returns. So the len function is defined roughly like this:\ndef len(x):\n    return x.__len__()\nSimilarly, the in operator call a secret __contains__ method.",

One reason is that whereas lists are more flexible, tuples are more efficient.

With conventional assignment statements, we have to use a temporary variable. For example, to swap a and b:\ntmp = a\na = b\nb = tmp\n\nExercise 13-4\nTry this and read the error message:\nfamily = (\"Donald\", \"Ivana\", \"Eric\")\nfather, mother = family\n\n\nExercise 13-5\nTry this and read the err or message:\nfamily = (\"Donald\", \"Ivana\", \"Eric\")\nfather, mother, son, daughter = family\nCompare to the error message in the previous exercise.\n\n\nExercise 13-6\nSay want to swap the values of two variable a and b. To do that you would need to keep one of the values in an extra variable like this:\ntemp = a\na = b\nb = temp\nCan you come up with a simple and pretty way of swapping a and b in one statement, using what you have learned in this chapter?

    "text": "The for-loop\nPrograms often need to do repetitive things. Consider this example below where x is assigned a value that is then printed:\nYou can see that we do the same thing four times with the only difference that the variable x takes a new value each time. Now carefully write the alternative version below and compare what is printed to what was printed in the above example.\nIt should be exactly the same. What you just wrote is called a for-loop. It is called a for-loop because it does something for each of many values – in this case for each value in our list.\nThe statements nested under the for-loop are run as many times as there are values in our list, and every time they are run x is assigned a new value. The first time the statements are run, x is assigned the first value in the list. The second time they are run x is assigned the second value in the list. This continues until x has been assigned all the values in the list.\nThe semantics of a for-loop is as follows:\nWhat is an iterable, you may ask? Actually, it is any kind of value that knows how to serve one value at a time until there are none left. Only objects that have an __iter__ method can do this. If you try to iterate over a value that does not have an __iter__ method you will get an error. Try the code below and see how Python complains that “‘int’ object is not iterable”:\nTry these variations of the for-loop above and notice how the rules 1-5 apply in each case:\nIn each case, the expression after in reduces to the value [1, 5, 3, 7], which then serves as the iterable.\nNot only lists are iterable. Strings are too. Their ‘iter’ method of a string tell it that it should serve once character at a time. Try this:\nNeat, right?.\nIn programming, you very often need to iterate over integer values, and sometimes quite a few (like the 250 million bases of the human chromosome one). It would be quite annoying if you had to manually make long lists of integers, so Python provides a builtin function called range that helps you out. It returns a special iterator value that lets you iterate over a specified range of numbers. Try the two examples below and compare what is printed:\nYou can see that using range works just like using a list of numbers, but the cool thing about range is that it does not return a list. It just serves one number at a time until it is done. This is also why you will not see a list if you try to print what range returns:\nThe range function needs three values to know which values to iterate over: “start”, “end” and “step”. If you do not give it all three arguments it will assume sensible defaults. Try this:\nYou can see that the first and the last arguments default to 0 and 1. If you give it two arguments it will assume that they are “start” and “end”. If you only give it one argument it will assume that it is the “end”.",

Make sure you understand why. Write and experiment with the code on your own.\nlist_of_words = ['one', 'two', 'three']\n\n# example 1\nfor word in list_of_words:\n    print(word)\n\n# example 2\nlist_length = len(list_of_words)\nfor index in range(list_length):\n    print(list_of_words[index])\n\n\nExercise 14-4\nFinish the code below so all the even numbers go into one list and all the odd numbers go into the other (hint: remember the modulo operator?)\nnumbers = [4, 9, 6, 7, 4, 5, 3, 2, 6]\neven = []\nodd = []\nfor n in numbers:\n    # your code here ...\n    \n    \n\n\nExercise 14-5\nYou can put any statements under the for-loop. Here it includes an if-statement that lets you generate a list of all the a characters in banana (in case you need that).\nresult = []\nfruit = 'banana'\nfor character in fruit:\n    if character == 'a':\n        result.append(character)\nprint(result)\nNow change the code so you instead get the indexes of the ‘a’ characters: [1, 3, 5]. Here are some hints:\n\nYou need a for-loop over a list of numbers.\nrange(len(fruit)) may be relevant numbers :-).\nfruit[1] substitutes for 'a'.\n\n\n\nExercise 14-6\nImagine you want to throw a big party and that you have a rented a place with room for 100 people. Now you want to start inviting people. What kind of error do you get here and why?\nfriends = [\"Mogens\", \"Preben\", \"Berit\"]\ninvited = []\nfor index in range(100):\n    invited.append(friends[index])\n\n\nExercise 14-7\nYou can also put a for-loop under another for loop, and the rules for each for loop are still those explained above: The statements nested under the for loop are indented with four spaces just like with if-statements. These statements are executed once for every value in the iterable. Think carefully about what you think is printed in the example below before you try it out.\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(3):\n        print(i, j)\nMake sure you understand i, j pairs are printed in the order they are.",

But remember: even though the code may mix lists, for-loops, and functions, the rules for lists, for-loops and functions are not mixed. The separate simple rules for a list, a for-loop and a function are still the same. If you get confused, it is time revisit the sections about each separate topic. You will probably have to do that many times during the course.\n\n\nExercise 16-16\nWrite a function, square_numbers, that takes a list of numbers as argument and returns a new list with the numbers squared.\n# write your function definition here ...\n\nnumbers = [1, 5, 3, 7]\n\n# then you can call it like this:\nsquared = squared_numbers(numbers)\n\n\nExercise 16-17\nWrite a function count_characters, which takes a string argument and returns a dictionary with the counts of each character in the string. When you call the function like this:\ncount_characters('banana')\nit must return (not necessarily with key-value pairs in that order):\n{'n': 2, 'b': 1, 'a': 3}\nThe technique you should use is the one you learned in Section 16.0.0.2. Here we just iterate over a string of characters instead of over a list of numbers. Here is a bit of code to help you along…\ndef count_characters(text):\n    counts = {}\n    # fill in the missing code ...\n\n    return counts\n\n\nExercise 16-18\nUse the function you made in the previous exercise to construct the following data structure:\n{ 'banana': {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2},\n  'apple': {'a': 1, 'e': 1, 'p': 2, 'l': 1}, \n  'ananas': {'a': 3, 's': 1, 'n': 2} }\nfrom this list:\n['banana', 'ananas', 'apple']\nHere is some code to help you along:\nmy_database = {}\nfor word in ['banana', 'ananas', 'apple']:\n    my_database[word] =  # you figure this out...\nOnce you are done, what value do you think my_database['banana'] represents? I.e. what will it reduce to if used in an expression? And what value does my_database['banana']['a'] represent?\n\n\nExercise 16-19\nRead the code below and make sure you understand each single step before you write any of it. Revisit previous sections if you must, go look in the Python documentation. Then write and run the code - and enjoy that it was exactly what you expected.\ndef get_words(text, search_string):\n    hits = []\n    for word in text.split():\n         if search_string in word:\n            hits.append(word)\n    return hits\n    \ns = 'eenie meenie minie moe'\nnie_words = get_words(s, 'nie')\nm_words = get_words(s, 'm')\n\nprint(' '.join(nie_words))\nprint(' '.join(m_words))\n\n\nExercise 16-20\nThis larger will take you through some of the most common string manipulations. A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same way backward and forwards.\nWrite a function, is_palindrome, which takes one argument:\n\nA string.\n\nThe function must return:\n\nTrue if the string argument is a palindrome and False otherwise.\n\nExample usage:\nis_palindrome('abcba')\nshould return True and\nis_palindrome('foo')\nshould return False\nOne approach to this is to run through s from the first to the middle character and for each character check if the character is equal to the character at the same index from the right rather than the left. Remember that the first character of a string is at index 0 and the last at index -1, the second character is at index 1 and the second last at index -2 and so forth.\nSince you need to run through the string from the first to the middle character you first need to figure out how many characters that corresponds to. Say your palindrome is \"ACTGTCA\", then the number of indexes you need to loop over with a for loop is:\ns = \"ACTGTCA\"\nnr_indexes = len(s)//2 \nFigure out how to make range() return indexes you can use to access the characters in the first half of the sequence. Then make a for loop where you iterate over the indexes you get from range(). Try to make the for-loop print out the first half of the characters, just to make sure you are using the right indexes.\nOnce you get this far you need to compare each character from the first half of the corresponding ones starting from the other end of the palindrome. Figure out how to change each index used for the first half to the corresponding index for the other half so you can compare the relevant pairs. (You need to compare index 0 with -1, 1 with -2 and so on…)\nNow try to make the for-loop print both the character from the first half and the corresponding character from the other end. If you got the indexes right you will see that the A print with the A from the other end, the C with the C and so on.\nWrite an if-statement in the for-loop that tests if the two corresponding characters are the same. If the string is a palindrome, then each pair is identical. So as soon as you see a pair which is not identical, you know it is not a palindrome and you can let your function return False like this:\nif left_character != right_character:\n    return False\nRemember that the function ends as soon as it encounters a return statement.\nIf all pairs pass the test, it means that the string is a palindrome, and the function should return True when exiting the for-loop.",

Having set up a series of tests also allows you to change and improve the implementation of your function without having to worry that it stops working they way it is supposed to.

So for each function, you can run tests to make sure it implements the behaviour it is supposed to.\nEach project comes with two files that you download from the course page. They have their names for a good reason, so do not change them. In the first project about translating DNA, they are called translationproject.py and test_translationproject.py.\nTo be able to test your functions, you must write your code in the file called translationproject.py. To run your code you type this in the Terminal as usual:\n\n\nTerminal\n\npython translationproject.py\n\nTo test the functions as you complete each one, you can run the test script test_translationproject.py like this:\n\n\nTerminal\n\npython test_translationproject.py\n\nThe code in test_translationproject.py reads your code in translationproject.py and performs a series of tests of each function. When you run the test script four things may happen depending on the state of your code:\nCase 1: If you did not yet implement all the functions, the test script will remind you (once for each test) that you did not implement the functions with the names required.\n\n\nTerminal\n\n*********************************************************\nATTENTION!

The reminders are meant as a safeguard to ensure that you do not hand in the assignment with missing or misspelled function definitions.\nCase 2: If a test for one the functions you have written fails, the testing is aborted and the script prints some information to help you understand what the problem could be. Say you wrote the function translate_codon wrongly so that it always returns M for some reason:\ndef translate_codon(codon):\n    return 'M' # crazy\nthen you would get this message:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nFAILED TEST CASE: test_translate_codon_2\n\nMESSAGE:\n    The call:\n\n        translate_codon('TAA')\n\n    returned:\n\n        'M'\n\n    However, it should return:\n\n        '*'\n\n======================================================================\nRan 4 tests in 0.001s\n\nFAILED (failures=1)\n\nIt is now left to you to figure out why your function returns the wrong value when called with these arguments.\nCase 3: If you defined all functions correctly and they all work the way they are supposed to, then the test script just prints:\nRan 14 tests in 0.140s\n\nOK",

    "text": "Make a matrix\nWe start out by making a list of lists (a matrix) that has the right shape but only holds None values. We use the None values as place-holders, which you can later replace with scores. You can think of it as an empty matrix that you can fill scores into, just as we did at the lectures. If you want to align two sequences like AT and GAT you want a matrix that has 3 rows and 4 columns. Note that the matrix must have one more row than the number of bases in sequence one, and one more column than the number of bases in sequence two.\nWrite a function, empty_matrix, that takes two arguments\n\nAn integer (which represents the length of sequence one + 1).\nAn integer (which represents the length of sequence two + 1).\n\nThe function must return:\n\nA list of lists. The number of sub-lists be must equal to the first integer argument. Each sublist must contain a number of None values equal to the second integer argument.\n\nExample usage:\nempty_matrix(3, 4)\nreturns a list with three lists each of length four:\n[[None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None]]\ndef empty_matrix(m, n):\n    matrix = []\n    for i in range(m):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(n):\n            row.append(None)\n        matrix.append(row)\n    return matrix\nEven though this is a list of lists we can think of it as a three by four matrix:\n[[None, None, None, None], \n [None, None, None, None], \n [None, None, None, None]]\nIf you want to print the matrix in a way that looks like the slides I showed you at the lecture, you can use the print_dp_matrix function (again None represents empty cells):\n          G    A    T\n  None None None None\nA None None None None\nT None None None None\nImportant: You can implement empty_matrix in a way superficially looks ok but will cause you all kinds of grief when you start filling it in. When you create the list of lists (e.g. three lists as above) you need to generate and add three separate lists. If you add the same list three times you do not have three separate rows in your matrix. Instead you have three references to the same row. You can test if you did it right this way – by changing the value of one cell to see what happens:\nempty = empty_matrix(3, 4)\nempty[0][0] = 'Mogens'\nprint(empty)\nIf this only changed one value like below, you are ok:\n[['Mogens', None, None, None], [None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None]]\nIf it changed the first value in all the lists, it means that all your lists are the same (which is not what you want).\n[['Mogens', None, None, None], ['Mogens', None, None, None], ['Mogens', None, None, None]]\n\n\nFill top row and left column\nNow that you can make a matrix with the correct dimensions, you need to write a function that fills in the top row and the left column in accordance with what the gap score is. E.g. if the gap score is -2 you want the matrix to look something like this when you print it with print_dp_matrix:\n          G    A    T\n     0   -2   -4   -6\nA   -2 None None None\nT   -4 None None None\nWrite a function, prepare_matrix, which takes three arguments:\n\nAn integer (which represents the length of sequence one plus one)\nAn integer (which represents the length of sequence two plus one)\nAn integer, which represents the gap_score used for alignment.\n\nThe function must return:\n\nA list of lists. The number of sub-lists be must equal to the first integer argument. The values in the first sub-list must be multiples of the gap score given as the third argument. The first elements of remaining sub-lists must be multiples of the gap score. All remaining elements of sub-lists must be None.\n\nExample usage:\nprepare_matrix(3, 4, -2)\nmust return:\n[[0, -2, -4, -6], [-2, None, None, None], [-4, None, None, None]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should call empty_matrix inside prepare_matrix to get a matrix filled with None.\n\n\n\nNow all you need to do is replace the right None values with multiples of the gap score. E.g. the third element in the first sub-list is matrix[2][0], which you would need to assign the value: 2 times the gap score. In the same way matrix[3][0] should be 3 times the gap score. So you need to figure out which elements you should replace and which pairs of indexes you need to access those elements. Then use range to generate those indexes and for-loops to loop over them.\ndef prepare_matrix(m, n, gap_score):\n\n    matrix = empty_matrix(m, n)\n\n    for i in range(len(matrix)):\n        matrix[i][0] = gap_score * i\n\n    for j in range(len(matrix[0])):\n        matrix[0][j] = gap_score * j\n\n    return matrix\n\n\nFill the entire matrix\nNow that we are able to fill the top row and left column we can start thinking about how to fill the whole matrix.\nFor that we need a score matrix of match scores. In Python that is most easily represented as a dictionary of dictionaries like this:\nscore_matrix = {'A': {'A': 2, 'T': 0, 'G': 0, 'C': 0},\n                'T': {'A': 0, 'T': 2, 'G': 0, 'C': 0},\n                'G': {'A': 0, 'T': 0, 'G': 2, 'C': 0},\n                'C': {'A': 0, 'T': 0, 'G': 0, 'C': 2}}\nThat lets you get the score for matching an A with a T like this: score_matrix['A']['T']. Note that the match scores are only for uppercase letters (A, T, G, C).\nWrite a function, fill_matrix, which takes four arguments:\n\nA string, which represents the first sequence.\nA string, which represents the second sequence.\nA dictionary of dictionaries like the one shown above, which represents match scores.\nAn integer, which represents the gap score.\n\nThe function must return:\n\nA list of lists of integers, which represents a correctly filled dynamic programming matrix given the two sequences, the match scores, and the gap score.\n\nExample usage: If score_matrix is defined as above then\nfill_matrix('AT', 'GAT', score_matrix, -2)\nmust return:\n[[0, -2, -4, -6], [-2, 0, 0, -2], [-4, -2, 0, 2]]\nIf you print that matrix using print_dp_matrix it should look like this:\n      G  A  T\n   0 -2 -4 -6\nA -2  0  0 -2\nT -4 -2  0  2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should call prepare_matrix inside fill_matrix to get a matrix with the top row and left column filled. Assuming seq1 is sequence one and seq2 is sequence two then you can do it like this:\nmatrix = prepare_matrix(len(seq1)+1, len(seq2)+1, gap_score)\n\n\n\nNow you only need to fill out the rest. To produce the indexes of the elements in the list of lists that you need to assign values to, you need two nested for-loops.\nfor i in range(1, len(seq1)+1):\n    for j in range(1, len(seq2)+1):\n        print(i, j) # just to see what i and j are\nExamine this code and make sure you understand why we give those arguments to range. Each combination of i and j let you access an element matrix[i][j] in matrix (list of lists) that you can to assign a value to. The value to assign to matrix[i][j] (green cell on the slides) is the maximum of three values (the yellow cells on the slide):\n\nThe value of the cell to the left (matrix[i][j-1]) plus the gap score.\nThe cell above (matrix[i-1][j]) plus the gap score.\nThe diagonal cell (matrix[i-1][j-1]) plus the match score for base number i (index i-1) of sequence one and base number j (index j-1) of sequence two.\n\ndef fill_matrix(seq1, seq2, score_matrix, gap_score):\n\n    matrix = prepare_matrix(len(seq1)+1, len(seq2)+1, gap_score)\n\n    for i in range(1, len(seq1)+1):\n        for j in range(1, len(seq2)+1):\n            base1 = seq1[i-1]\n            base2 = seq2[j-1]\n            diag = matrix[i-1][j-1] + score_matrix[base1][base2]\n            left = matrix[i][j-1] + gap_score\n            up = matrix[i-1][j] + gap_score\n            matrix[i][j] = max(left, up, diag)\n\n    return matrix",

We split the solution to this problem in two.

That is, the count of that codon divided by the total of all codon counts in the dictionary. The frequencies for codons that encode the same amino acid must of sum to one.

You already know how matrices can be represented by lists of lists. E.g. a matrix like this:\n0.0  0.1  0.3  0.3  0.1  0.2\n0.1  0.0  0.2  0.4  0.1  0.1\n0.3  0.2  0.0  0.4  0.2  0.3\n0.3  0.4  0.4  0.0  0.2  0.1\n0.1  0.1  0.2  0.2  0.0  0.1\n0.2  0.1   0.3  0.1  0.1 0.0\n\ncan be expressed as a list of lists like this:\n[[0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2],\n [0.1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1],\n [0.3, 0.2, 0.0, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3],\n [0.3, 0.4, 0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1],\n [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.0, 0.1],\n [0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0]]\nNotice how the diagonal is all zeros because these distances represent the distance of a sequence to itself. Also, notice that the part above the diagonal is a mirror the part below the diagonal (in bold). This is all a bit redundant, especially in this project where you will have to reduce the matrix as you group (or cluster) sequences together. We want something nice and lean where we only have the numbers we need – and that is the lower triangular matrix:\n0.1\n0.3 0.2\n0.3 0.4 0.4\n0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2\n0.2 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.1\nIn Python this is still just a list of lists, only, each sublist now has the same length as its index in the big list (E.g. [0.3, 0.2] has index 2 in the list and has length 2):\nmatrix = [[],\n              [0.1],\n              [0.3, 0.2],\n              [0.3, 0.4, 0.4],\n              [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2],\n              [0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1]]\nHere I am just writing it nicely. If you where to print that list of lists it would look like this:\n[[], [0.1], [0.3, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4, 0.4], [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2], [0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1]]\nSay your sequences had names: A, B, C, D, E, and F, then the above data structure represents distances between each pair like this:\nA \nB 0.1\nC 0.3 0.2\nD 0.3 0.4 0.4\nE 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2\nF 0.2 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.1\n   A   B   C   D   E   F\nThere is only one drawback with this reduced representation of the full square matrix: In the full matrix you can get the distance between the sequences with indexes i and j as both matrix[i][j] and matrix[j][i] because the part above and below the diagonal are the same. Using the lower triangular matrix, you must always use the largest index first. Using the smaller one first will give you an IndexError. So if you want the distance between sequences with index 2 and 4, you must use the bigger index first (as the row index): matrix[4][2].",

If your list looks like this before you call the function:\nlabels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\nThen after you call the function like this update_labels(labels, 1, 0), the list will look like this:\n['(A,B)', 'C', 'D']\nHere is the function:\ndef update_labels(labels, i, j):\n\n    # turn the label at first index into a combination of both labels\n    labels[j] = \"({},{})\".format(labels[j], labels[i])\n\n    # Remove the (now redundant) label in the first index\n    del labels[i]\n\n\nUpdating the matrix\nThe function update_table takes three arguments:\n\nA list of lists, which represents a lower triangular distance matrix.\nAn integer representing the index of one of the elements to join.\nAn integer representing the index of the other element to join.\n\nThe way this function is implemented, it is assumed that the second argument is always larger than the third argument. I.e. the second argument is a row index and the third argument is a column index.\nThe function does not return anything, but it updates the matrix to reflect that a pair has been joined. If your matrix looks like this before you call the function:\nm = [[], [0.1], [0.3, 0.4], [0.6, 0.8, 0.2]]\nThen after you call the function like this update_table(m, 1, 0), the matrix will look like this:\n[[], [0.35], [0.7, 0.2]]\nHere is the function:\ndef update_table(table, a, b):\n\n    # For the lower index, reconstruct the entire row (ORANGE)\n    for i in range(0, b):\n        table[b][i] = link(table[b][i], table[a][i])\n\n    # Link cells to update the column above the min cell (BLUE)\n    for i in range(b+1, a):\n        table[i][b] = link(table[i][b], table[a][i])\n        \n    # Link cells to update the column below the min cell (RED)\n    for i in range(a+1, len(table)):\n        table[i][b] = link(table[i][b], table[i][a])\n\n    # Delete cells we no longer need (lighter colors)\n    for i in range(a+1, len(table)):\n        # Remove the (now redundant) first index column entry\n        del table[i][a]\n    # Remove the (now redundant) first index row\n    del table[a] \nThe colors refer to cell colors on the slide you I showed you at the lecture.\n\n\nDo the clustering\nNow onto the real task, the actual clustering. The function cluster takes two arguments:\n\nA list of strings representing DNA sequences of equal length.\nA list of strings representing sequence names.\n\nThe function returns:\n\nA string representing the generated clustering.\n\nHere is the function:\ndef cluster(sequences, names):\n\n    table = lower_trian_matrix(sequences)\n    labels = names[:]\n\n    # Until all labels have been joined...\n    while len(labels) &gt; 1:\n        # Locate lowest cell in the table\n        i, j = find_lowest_cell(table)\n\n        # Join the table on the cell co-ordinates\n        update_table(table, i, j)\n\n        # Update the labels accordingly\n        update_labels(labels, i, j)\n\n    # Return the final label\n    return labels[0]\nHere is a simple example of how you can use your new clustering code:\nnames = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\nsequences = ['TAAAAAAAAAAA', \n             'TTAAAAAAAAAA', \n             'AAAAAAAAAAGG', \n             'AAAAAAAAGGGG']\n\ntree = cluster(sequences, names)\nprint(tree)\n\n\nOn your own\nFrom here on you are on your own. If you find a FASTA file with aligned (ungapped) homologous sequences, you can use the function below to read it into your program and try your code out on real-world sequences. I will leave it to you to figure out how it works.\ndef read_fasta(filename):\n    f = open(filename, 'r')\n    record_list = []\n    header = \"\"\n    sequence = \"\"\n    for line in f:\n        line = line.strip() ## get rid of whitespace and newline\n        if line.startswith(\"&gt;\"):\n            if header != \"\": ## if it is the first header\n                record_list.append([header, sequence])\n                sequence = \"\"\n            header = line[1:]\n        else:\n            sequence += line\n    record_list.append([header, sequence])\n    return record_list",

    "text": "Find the start positions of ORFs in a DNA sequence\nThe first task is to write a function that finds all the possible positions where an ORF can begin.\nWrite a function, find_start_positions, which takes one argument:\n\nA string, which is a DNA sequence.\n\nThe function must return:\n\nA list of integers, which represent the indexes of the first base in start codons in the DNA sequence argument.\n\nExample usage:\nfind_start_positions('TATGCATGATG')\nshould return\n[1, 5, 8]\nYour function should contain a for-loop that iterates over all possible positions in a DNA string where a codon can begin. Not surprisingly, these are all the positions except for the last two. So start out with this:\ndef find_start_positions(seq):\n    for i in range(len(seq) - 2):\n        print(i)\nNow, instead of just printing i, try and make it print the three bases following i using the slicing technique:\ntriplet = seq[i:i+3]\nI.e. if your sequence is 'TATGCATGATG' it should first print 'TAT' then 'ATG' then 'TGC' and so on.\nWhen you have this working you should change the code so that triplets are only printed if they are start codons. You can use an if-statement that tests if each triplet is equal to start_codon.\nThen try and make your function print i only when i is the first base of a start codon.\nFinally, modify the function so all the relevant values of i are collected in a list using the same technique as in the split_codons(orf) function, and then return this list from the function.\n\n\n\nFinding the next occurrence of some codon in an ORF\nNow that you can find where the ORFs begin in our sequence you must also be able to identify where each of these end. As you know, an ORF ends at any of three different stop codons in the same reading frame as the start codon. So, starting at the start codon of the ORF, we need to be able to find the next occurrence of some specific codon. I.e. you should look at all codons after the start codon and find the first occurrence of some specified codon. If the function does not find that codon in the string it should return None.\nWrite a function, find_next_codon, that takes three arguments:\n\nA string, which is the DNA sequence.\nAn integer, which is the index in the sequence where the ORF starts.\nA string, which is the codon to find the next occurrence of.\n\nThe function must return:\n\nAn integer, which is the index of the first base in the next in-frame occurrence of the codon. If the function does not find that codon in the string it should return None.\n\nExample usage:\nfind_next_codon('AAAAATTTAATTTAA', 1, 'TTT')\nshould return\n10\nYour function should contain a for-loop that iterates over all the relevant starts of codons. Remember that no valid codon can start at the last two positions in the sequence. E.g. if the second argument is 7 and the length of the sequence is 20 then the relevant indexes are 7, 10, 13, 16.\nStart by writing a function just with a for-loop that lets you print these indexes produced by range. Figure out how to make the range function iterate over the appropriate numbers.\ndef find_next_codon(seq, start, codon):\n    for idx in range( ?? ):\n        print(idx)\nWhen you have that working, use the slicing technique to instead print the codons that start at each index.\nFinally, add an if-statement that tests if each codon is equal to codon. When this is true, the function should return the value of idx.\n\n\n\nFinding the first stop codon in an ORF\nNow that you can find the next occurrence of any codon, you are well set up to write a function that finds the index for the beginning of the next in-frame stop codon in an ORF.\nWrite a function, find_next_stop_codon, that takes two arguments:\n\nA string, which is the DNA sequence.\nAn integer, which is the index in the sequence where the ORF starts.\n\nThe function must return:\n\nAn integer, which is the index of the first base in the next in-frame stop codon. If there is no in-frame stop codon in the sequence the function should return None.\n\nExample usage:\nfind_next_stop_codon('AAAAATAGATGAAAA', 2)\nshould return\n5\nHere is some inspiration:\n\nYou should define a list to hold the indexes for the in-frame stop codons we find.\nThen we loop over the three possible stop codons to find the next in-frame occurrence of each one from the start index. You can use find_next_codon for this. Remember that it returns None if it does not find any. If it does find a position you can add it to your list.\nAt the end, you should test if you have any indexes in your list.\nIf you do, you should return the smallest index in the list. I.e the ones closest to the start codon.\nIf you did not find any stop codons the function must return None to indicate this.\n\n\n\n\nFinding ORFs\nNow you can write a function that uses find_start_positions and find_next_stop_codon to extract the start and end indexes of each ORF in a genomic sequence.\nWrite a function, find_orfs, that takes one argument:\n\nA string, which is a DNA sequence.\n\nThe function should return:\n\nA list, which contains lists with two integers. The list returned must contain a list for each ORF in the sequence argument. These lists each contain two integers. The first integer represents the start of the ORF, the second represents the end. The function should handle both uppercase and lowercase sequences.\n\nExample usage:\nfind_orfs(\"AAAATGGGGTAGAATGAAATGA\")\nshould return\n[[3, 9], [13, 19]]\nStart by using find_start_positions to get a list of all the start positions in sequence:\ndef find_orfs(seq):\n    start_positions = find_start_positions(seq)\nWhen you have that working, add a for-loop that iterates over the start positions. Inside the for-loop, you can then get the next in-frame stop codon for each start position by calling find_next_stop_codon. Try to print the start and end indexes you find to make sure the code does what you think.\nFinally, you need to add a [start, stop] list for each ORF to the big list that the function returns. To append a list to a list you do write something like this:\norf_coordinate_list.append([start, stop])\nTest your function. Chances are that some of the end positions you get are None. This is because some of the start codons were not followed by an in-frame stop codon. Add an if-statement to your function that controls that only start-stop pairs with a valid stop coordinate are added to the list of results.",

    "text": "Compute overlaps between reads\nNext thing is to figure out which reads overlap each other. To do that we need a function that takes two read sequences and computes their overlap. Remember that in the input data none of the reads are completely nested in another read.\n\nCompute the overlap between two reads\nWe know that there are no sequencing errors, so in the overlap, the sequence match will be perfect. To compute the overlap between the 3’ (right) end of the left read with the 5’ (left) end of the right read, you need to loop over all possible overlaps honoring that one sequence is the left one and the other is the right one. In the for loop, start with the largest possible overlap ( min(len(left), len(right))) and evaluate smaller and smaller overlaps until you find an exact match.\nWrite a function, get_overlap, that takes two arguments\n\nA string, which is the left read sequence.\nA string, which is the right read sequence.\n\nThe function must return\n\nA string, which is the overlapping sequence. If there is no overlap it should return an empty string.\n\nExample usage:\ns1 = \"CGATTCCAGGCTCCCCACGGGGTACCCATAACTTGACAGTAGATCTC\"\ns2 = \"GGCTCCCCACGGGGTACCCATAACTTGACAGTAGATCTCGTCCAGACCCCTAGC\"\nget_overlap(s1, s2)\nshould return the string\n'GGCTCCCCACGGGGTACCCATAACTTGACAGTAGATCTC'\nand get_overlap(s2, s1)\nshould return the string\n'C'\nFrom these two examples it seems that s1 and s2 overlap and that s1 is the left one and s2 is the right one. Treating s2 as the left one and s1 as the right one only gives an overlap of one base (we expect a few bases of overlap even for unrelated sequences).\n\n\n\n\nCompute all read overlaps\nWhen you have written get_overlap you can use it to evaluate the overlap between all pairs of reads in both left-right and right-left orientations.\nWrite a function, get_all_overlaps, that takes one argument:\n\nA dictionary with read data as returned by read_data.\n\nThe function must return\n\nA dictionary of dictionaries, specifying the number of overlapping bases for a pair of reads in a specific left-right orientation. Computing the overlap of a read to itself is meaningless and must not be included. Assuming the resulting dictionary of dictionaries is called d, then d['Read2'] will be a dictionary where keys are the names of reads that have an overlap with read 'Read2' when 'Read2' is put in the left position, and the values for these keys are the number of overlapping bases for those reads.\n\nExample usage: assuming that reads is a dictionary returned by read_data then:\nget_all_overlaps(reads)\nshould return the following dictionary of dictionaries (but not necessarily with the same ordering of the key-value pairs):\n{'Read1': {'Read3': 0, 'Read2': 1, 'Read5': 1, 'Read4': 0, 'Read6': 29},\n 'Read3': {'Read1': 0, 'Read2': 0, 'Read5': 0, 'Read4': 1, 'Read6': 1},\n 'Read2': {'Read1': 13, 'Read3': 1, 'Read5': 21, 'Read4': 0, 'Read6': 0},\n 'Read5': {'Read1': 39, 'Read3': 0, 'Read2': 1, 'Read4': 0, 'Read6': 14},\n 'Read4': {'Read1': 1, 'Read3': 1, 'Read2': 17, 'Read5': 2, 'Read6': 0},\n 'Read6': {'Read1': 0, 'Read3': 43, 'Read2': 0, 'Read5': 0, 'Read4': 1}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the get_overlap function you just made to find the overlap between a pair of reads. To generate all combinations of reads you need two for-loops. One looping over reads in left positions and another (inside the first one) looping over reads in right position. Remember that we do not want the overlap of a read to itself, so there should be an if-statement in the checking of the left and right reads are the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint overlaps as a nice table\nThe dictionary returned by get_all_overlaps is a little messy to look at. We want to print it in a nice matrix-like format so we can better see which pairs overlap in what orientations.\nThis pretty_print function, should take one argument:\n\nA dictionary of dictionaries as returned by get_all_overlaps.\n\nThe function should not return anything but must print a matrix exactly as shown in the example below with nicely aligned and right-justified columns. The first column must hold names of reads in left orientation. The top row holds names of reads in right orientation. Remaining cells must each hold the number of overlapping bases for a left-right read pair. The diagonal corresponds to overlaps to the read itself. You must put dashes in these cells.\nExample usage: assuming that overlaps is a dictionary of dictionaries returned by get_all_overlaps then:\npretty_print(overlaps)\nshould print exactly\n       Read1  Read2  Read3  Read4  Read5  Read6 \nRead1      -      1      0      0      1     29 \nRead2     13      -      1      0     21      0\nRead3      0      0      -      1      0      1\nRead4      1     17      1      -      2      0 \nRead5     39      1      0      0      -     14 \nRead6      0      0     43      1      0      -\nThis function is hard to get completely right. So to spare you the frustration, this one is on me:\ndef pretty_print(d):\n    print('      ', end='')\n    for j in sorted(d):\n        print(\"{: &gt;6}\".format(j), end='')\n    print()\n    for i in sorted(d):\n        print(\"{: &gt;6}\".format(i), end='')\n        for j in sorted(d):\n            if i == j:\n                s = '     -'\n            else:\n                s = \"{: &gt;6}\".format(d[str(i)][str(j)])\n            print(s, end='')\n        print()\nMake sure you understand how it works.

    "text": "Find the right order of reads\nNow that we know how the reads overlap we can chain them together pair by pair from left to right to get the order in which they represent the genomic sequence. To do this we take the first (left-most) read and identify which read has the largest overlap to its right end. Then we take that read and find the read with the largest overlap to the right end of that - and so on until we reach the rightmost (last) read.\n\nFind the first read\nThe first thing you need to do is to identify the first (leftmost) read so we know where to start. This read is identified as the one that has no significant (&gt;2) overlaps to its left end (it only has a good overlap when positioned to the left of other reads). In the example output from pretty_print above the first read would be read 'Read4' because the 'Read4' column has no significant overlaps (no one larger than two).\nWe break the problem in two and first write a function that gets all the overlaps to the left end of a read (i.e. when it is in the right position):\nWrite a function, get_left_overlaps, that takes two arguments:\n\nA dictionary of dictionaries as returned from get_all_overlaps.\nA string, which represents the name of a read.\n\nThe function must return\n\nA sorted list of integers, which represent the overlaps of other reads to its left end.\n\nExample usage: assuming that overlaps is a dictionary of dictionaries returned by get_all_overlaps then.\nget_left_overlaps(overlaps, 'Read1')\nshould return\n[0, 0, 1, 13, 39]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have made a list of left overlaps, you can use the builtin function sorted to make a sorted version of the list that you can return from the function.\n\n\n\nOK, now that we have a function that can find all the overlaps to the left end of a given read, all we need to do is find the particular read that have no signifiant (&gt;2) overlaps to its left end.\nWrite a function, find_first_read, that takes one argument:\n\nA dictionary of dictionaries as returned from get_all_overlaps.\n\nThe function must return\n\nA string containing the name of the first read.\n\nExample usage: assuming that overlaps is a dictionary of dictionaries returned by get_all_overlaps then.\nfind_first_read(overlaps)\nshould return\n'Read4'\n\n\nFind the order of reads\nNow that we have the first read we can find the correct ordering of reads. We want a list of the read names in the right order.\nGiven the first (left) read, the next read is the one that has the largest overlap to the right end of that read. To figure out which read that is, we use our dictionary of overlaps. If the first read is 'Read4' then overlaps['Read4'] is a dictionary of reads with overlap to the right end of read 'Read4'. So to find the name of the read with the largest overlap you must write a function that finds the key associated with the largest value in a dictionary. We do that first:\nWrite a function, find_key_for_largest_value, that takes one argument:\n\nA dictionary.\n\nThe function must return the key associated with the largest value in the dictionary argument.\nHaving written find_key_for_largest_value you can use it as a tool in the function the finds the order of reads:\nWrite a function, find_order_of_reads, that takes two arguments:\n\nA string, which is the name of the first (left-most) read (that returned by find_first_read).\nA dictionary of dictionaries, of all overlaps (that returned by get_all_overlaps).\n\nThe function must return\n\nA list of strings, which are read names in the order in which they represent the genomic sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know the first read is given by the first argument to the function, you also know that you can find the next read in the chain of overlapping reads by using the find_key_for_largest_value function, and you know that you should keep adding on reads to the chain as long as the overlap is larger than two (you can use a for-loop with an if-statement inside to check that the overlap is larger than 2).\n\n\n\nExample usage: assuming that overlaps is a dictionary of dictionaries returned by get_all_overlaps then:\nfind_order_of_reads('Read4', overlaps)\nshould return:\n['Read4', 'Read2', 'Read5', 'Read1', 'Read6', 'Read3']\nMake sure you understand why this is the right list of read names before you try to implement the function.",

    "text": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus targets immune cells\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infects immune cells by specifically targeting and binding to certain receptors on the surface of these cells. The primary immune cells that HIV infects are CD4+ T cells (commonly known as T-helper cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells. Here’s a simplified step-by-step explanation of how HIV infects immune cells: The first step in the infection process involves the attachment of HIV to immune cells. The virus carries a glycoprotein on its surface called gp120, which binds to the CD4 receptor on the surface of CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This interaction is the initial binding event between the virus and the host cell. After binding to CD4, HIV also requires a co-receptor to gain entry into the host cell. Two common co-receptors used by the virus are CCR5 and CXCR4. Depending on the viral strain, it can use one or both of these co-receptors. This interaction between gp120 and the co-receptor triggers a conformational change in the virus, allowing it to fuse with the host cell membrane. The conformational change in the virus membrane allows it to fuse with the host cell membrane. This fusion event enables the virus to release its genetic material into the interior of the host cell. Once inside the host cell, HIV carries an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which converts its single-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded DNA. This process is known as reverse transcription.\nThe newly formed viral DNA is transported into the cell’s nucleus, where it is integrated into the host cell’s DNA. The enzyme integrase plays a critical role in this step. Once integrated, the viral DNA becomes a permanent part of the host cell’s genetic material. The integrated viral DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated by the host cell’s machinery to produce viral proteins and RNA. This leads to the assembly of new viral particles. New viral particles are assembled in the host cell and are released from the cell’s surface in a process known as budding. The new virus particles can go on to infect other immune cells and continue the cycle of infection. As HIV continues to infect and replicate within CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, the immune system’s response is compromised. Over time, the gradual loss of CD4+ T cells, which are crucial for coordinating the immune response, weakens the immune system’s ability to defend the body against various infections. This progressive immune system decline eventually leads to the clinical symptoms associated with AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).",

    "text": "Can specific gene variants provide resistance to HIV?\nThe CCR5 gene and its protective variant, CCR5-delta32, thus play a pivotal role in the complex interplay between human genetics and HIV. The CCR5 gene, specifically its CCR5-delta32 mutation, has garnered significant attention in the field of HIV research due to its remarkable ability to confer a degree of natural resistance against the virus. The CCR5 gene, short for “C-C chemokine receptor type 5,” encodes a protein receptor found on the surface of certain immune cells, including T-cells and macrophages. This receptor acts as a gateway for HIV to enter these cells, a critical step in the virus’s infection cycle. However, a naturally occurring genetic variant of CCR5 known as CCR5-delta32 possesses a mutation that renders the receptor non-functional. Individuals who inherit two copies of this mutation are notably resistant to HIV infection, as the virus struggles to enter and infect their immune cells. This extraordinary genetic resistance has raised considerable interest in the scientific and medical communities, as it offers insights into potential HIV treatment strategies and the development of innovative therapies.\nThe frequency of the CCR5-delta32 variant varies significantly across different populations worldwide. It is important to note that historical factors, such as population migrations, genetic bottlenecks, and the prevalence of diseases like HIV, can influence the presence and distribution of this protective mutation. Here’s an overview of the frequency of the CCR5-delta32 mutation in different regions: The CCR5-delta32 mutation is most common in populations of Northern European descent, particularly in Scandinavia. In some regions of Northern Europe, such as Sweden and Finland, the mutation can be found in approximately 10-15% of the population. This high prevalence is thought to have resulted from strong selection pressures due to past epidemics, like the bubonic plague. As you move southward in Europe, the frequency of the CCR5-delta32 mutation decreases. In Southern European countries like Spain and Italy, the prevalence drops to about 5% or even lower. The CCR5-delta32 mutation is relatively rare in African, Asian, and Indigenous populations. In most cases, it occurs in less than 1% of these populations. The low frequency can be attributed to the historical lack of selective pressure from diseases like HIV in these regions.",

A FASTA has two elements for each sequence: a header line with a leading ” &gt;” character followed by one or more lines with the DNA or protein sequence (the sequence may be broken over several lines).

    "text": "Database Searching using BLAST\n\nExercise 29-4\nGo to the NCBI BLAST web portal. Use the mecA nucleotide sequence to search for similar sequences in the nucleotide database. Which organisms have regions with high similarity to the mecA gene nucleotide sequence in your query? Tip: Check the “Show results in a new window” to allow searching multiple times and compare results. Further, know that it is normal for blasting to take a few minutes. Examine the following metrics (columns):\n\nE-value (Expect value): The number of hits one can “expect” to see by chance when searching a database of a particular size. Lower E-values indicate a more significant match. Typically, E-values below 0.05 or especially 0.01 suggest a significant match, but the threshold can depend on the content and especially the size of the search. The longer a search term, the less likely it is for random matches.\nPercent Identity: The percentage of identical matches between the query and subject sequences over the aligned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 29-5\nTry adjusting the number of maximum target sequences in “Algorithm Parameters” (e.g., to 1000). You can also exclude “Staphylococcus aureus” from the search results to only see other organisms.\n\nHow did this affect the results?\nCheck the taxonomy of your found organisms.\nCheck the graphic summary of the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nYou get more results and higher diversity in found organisms, including some that could be much more different to MRSA. You get results with lower E-value but which may be of relevance when determining the origins of the MecA gene.\nThe taxonomy lists the matches per organism. It gives a better overview than the “Descriptions” page.\nThe graphical summary shows that most of the matches match completely while some only overlap partially.\n\n(I used 500 max matches)\n\n\n\n\nExercise 29-6\nTry the other programs (“Program Selection”). They may be slower but can find less similar matches that may uncover the potential sources of the gene.\n\nDid this affect the results? If so, how? (Use the taxonomy and graphic summary in your analysis.)\nWhat are the main differences between the programs (megablast, discontiguous megablast, and blastn).\nWhat do we expect from the different algorithms? It is okay to use Wikipedia or similar resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nThis depends on their experimentation. The idea is for them to look through the different panes (graphical, taxonomy, etc.). Depending on settings, the difference may be little.\nThe (?) help box on the site mentions the following:\n\nMegablast is intended for comparing a query to closely related sequences and works best if the target percent identity is 95% or more but is very fast.\nDiscontiguous megablast uses an initial seed that ignores some bases (allowing mismatches) and is intended for cross-species comparisons.\nBlastN is slow, but allows a word-size down to seven bases.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 29-7\nTry the protein blast algorithms and compare the findings. This requires the protein sequence. Do you find the MecA gene product (i.e., protein) in other types of bacteria (i.e., not Staphylococcus strains)? If so, what may this imply about horizontal gene transfer of this gene? Is there a risk of MRSA “helping” completely different, and perhaps more dangerous, bacteria genera become antibiotics resistant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nThe protein matches with multiple Mammaliicoccus strains and even a hypothetical salmonella protein. It could mean that horizontal gene transfer between different bacteria genera happened. Note that Mammaliicoccus is a genus of bacteria that was previously classified within the Staphylococcus genus, so they are closely related. Also, these databases can have wrongly labeled information etc., so the salmonella match may not be relevant.\nOn the risk of HGT between very different genera, chatGPT says:\nThe mecA gene in MRSA is located on a mobile genetic element called the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). This element has been primarily identified in staphylococci. Whether this gene can transfer to other bacterial genera, such as Salmonella, depends on several factors: - Presence of Mobile Genetic Elements: The mecA gene would need to be on a mobile genetic element that’s compatible with the recipient bacteria’s machinery. While SCCmec has so far been primarily found in Staphylococcus species, the potential for its transfer to other genera is not zero, but likely low. - Ecological Overlap: For HGT to occur, the donor and recipient bacteria often need to inhabit the same or overlapping environments. Bacteria in the human gut, for instance, have more opportunities for gene exchange than bacteria from disparate habitats. - Cellular Barriers: Different bacterial genera might have barriers that prevent the uptake of foreign DNA. Gram-negative bacteria, for example, have an outer membrane that can act as a barrier to DNA uptake. - Selective Pressure: Even if the gene is transferred, it needs to confer a survival advantage for it to be maintained in the population. For example, in the presence of methicillin or other beta-lactams, a bacterium with the mecA gene would have a survival advantage.\nTo date, there’s no documented evidence of the mecA gene transferring from Staphylococcus to genera like Salmonella. However, other resistance genes have been documented to jump between genera. For instance, resistance genes carried on plasmids, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes, have been found in various Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli and Klebsiella. If such a transfer were to occur, especially to a pathogen with a different route of infection or resistance to other drugs, it could pose a significant public health concern. It’s essential to continue monitoring and researching antibiotic resistance to identify and respond to new threats as they emerge.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 29-8\nYou might see multiple Staphylococcus strains when allowing higher maximum target sequences. What are the potential interpretations of this concerning horizontal gene transfer? Can we deduce a single origin of the gene in Staphylococcus aureus from these results? Remember that we see a snapshot of where the genes were present during various studies – this is ever-changing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nIt probably does suggest HGT is very likely between the Staphylococcus strains. But it doesn’t tell us the order of the transferring. We’re just seeing a snapshot of the “current” state.\n\n\n\n\nExericse 29-9\nAccording to Bloemendaal et al. (2010): “Methicillin Resistance Transfer from Staphylococcus epidermidis to Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in a Patient during Antibiotic Therapy”, mecA may be transferred from Staphylococcus epidermidis. The mecA gene is located on the Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec), and they found that the SCCmec were almost identical in MRSA and in S. epidermidis in a patient.\n\nDoes your results imply this may be true?\nIf this was the case in that one patient, does it mean the MecA gene in MRSA always stems from S. epidermidis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nThey should see Staphylococcus epidermidis in their results, implying it could be true.\nWe cannot conclude from one patient getting it from S. epidermidis that it always comes from there.",

Make a FASTA file containing the nucleotide sequence of the COI (COX1) gene of all the reference animals and the Aardvark. Use the file “animals.fasta” to insert the nucleotide sequences. You can find the nucleotide sequences in the NCBI Nucleotide database. To search for genes, select “Gene” instead of nucleotide from the drop-down menu. If you where looking for the PRDM9 gene in humans you would, you search like this:\nPRDM9[Gene Name] AND Homo sapiens[Orgn]\nThe [Gene Name] and [Orgn] tags tells the database that “PRDM9” should be interpreted as a gene name, and “Homo sapiens” as an organism. This greatly limits your search and excludes database entries where the same words appear in other contexts. Have a quick look at the complete list of search terms available.\nYou are looking for COX1 and Orycteropus afer is the Latin name for Aardvark. This guides you to the page containing the database information for the COI gene for the specific organism (animal). You can find the gene sequence in a fasta format in the section “NCBI Reference Sequences (RefSeq).” Copy the gene sequence and paste it into the animals.fasta file under the appropriate header.

An outgroup is a sequence so distantly related animal to all your other sequences (your “ingroup”) that you can safely assume that all your ingroup sequences find a common ancestor before before they find one with the outgroup sequence (Figure 30.3). The point where the outgroup attaches to the ingroup tree must then be the common ancestor of your ingroup sequences. Since all your subject animals are all live-bearing mammals, you can use the platypus (a monotreme)(Ornithorhynchus anatinus) as the outgroup and add it to your fasta-file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 30.3: Ingroup and outgroup in a phylogeny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nThe students will be given a fasta-file containing only headers.

Here is a rundown of the most important ones:\nThe Jukes-Cantor model is one of the simplest nucleotide substitution models. It assumes that all types of nucleotide substitutions (transitions and transversions) occur at an equal rate, meaning that there’s a single rate parameter for all types of substitutions. This is a highly simplified model and is often used as a baseline for comparison with more complex models.\nThe Kimura two-parameter model is a simple model that takes into account two types of substitutions: transitions (purine-to-purine or pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine changes) and transversions (purine-to-pyrimidine or vice versa). It assumes that transitions occur at a different rate (\\(\\alpha\\)) than transversions (\\(\\beta\\)), reflecting the fact that transitions are often more common in DNA evolution.\nThe HKY85 model is a relatively simple model that takes into account two major factors in the evolution of nucleotide sequences: transitions (purine-to-purine or pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine changes) and transversions (purine-to-pyrimidine or vice versa). It assumes that transitions and transversions occur at different rates, which makes it more biologically realistic compared to some simpler models like the Jukes-Cantor model.\nThe GTR model is a more complex and flexible model compared to HKY85. It allows for different substitution rates between all possible pairs of nucleotides, making it a highly general model. This means that it can accommodate variations in the substitution rates of all six possible types of nucleotide changes (A\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)C, A\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)G, A\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)T, C\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)G, C\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)T, G\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)T).\nThe Hamming distance is not a traditional substitution model used for phylogenetics. It is a simple method for comparing sequences of equal length, where it counts the number of positions at which two sequences differ (i.e., the number of substitutions needed to convert one sequence into another). It does not consider the specific types of substitutions (transitions or transversions).\nWhat might be the reason for not alway choosing the model with the largest number of parameters?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 30-8\nLet’s explore how the evolutionary distances change when you use other models and also how the different tree construction methods make a difference. You can du this by running the steps from the “one-step” analysis, but change the model of DNA evolution to explore how this affects your results.\nYou will start at step 1: Multiple sequence alignment. You need a multiple alignments of all your sequences. Lucky for you, www.phylogeny.fr has already done that in order to make the tree. Here, the MUSCLE program has been used (MUSCLE is conceptually close to ClustalW). We will not change the alignment method. To access the multiple alignments, click on the tab “3. Alignment”. To see the curated that, click on the tab “4. Curation”. In this tab, the alignment has been curated by the program Gblocks. Gblocks has identified the portions of the alignment suitable for distance calculation and tree-building and has underlined these portions with a dark blue box. You can read more about Gblocks in the Gblocks documentation. Go read the introduction in the Gblocks documentation. What kind of positions are excluded after curation?\nDownload the curated alignment by clicking on “Cured alignment in Phylip format” under the Outputs section. This gives you the equal-length aligned sequences resulting from curation by Gblocks in a phy-file. Go read the introduction in the Gblocks documentation. What kind of positions are NOT included after curation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\n“The selected blocks must fulfill certain requirements with respect to the lack of large segments of contiguous nonconserved positions, lack or low density of gap positions and high conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment more suitable for phylogenetic analysis”\n\n\n\n\nExercise 30-9\nNow you can see what happens if we use the same alignment same curation, but different evolutionary models to calculate the evolutionary distances. To help you calculate the evolutionary distances, www.phylogeny.fr has some nice options for calculating distance matrices for you. Let’s start by building phylogenetic trees using PhyML.\nPhyML (Phylogenetic Maximum Likelihood) employs a statistical approach (maximum likelihood) to estimate the most likely tree given the input alignment. To Use PhyML, navigate to the top, tap “Online Programmes,” and choose PhyML. Here you can upload your curated alignment in phylip format (the one you downloaded from the curation tab).\nPhyML now lets you choose a substitution model. A substitution model is a mathematical model that describes how genetic sequences change over time. So now you will see how these different models actually affect your tree.

BioNJ stands for “Biased Neighbor Joining,” which is an adaptation of the neighbor-joining algorithm (not currently a part of www.phylogeny.fr). Neighbour Joining is a distance-based tree-building method, and BioNJ uses the same approach, with a slight bias, to avoid errors with particularly long branches.

The sequencing method is shown in the below figure. The biggest strength of this sequencing technique is that the reads are read multiple times. Every time the read is read, a subread is produced, and the final HiFi read is the consensus of all the subreads. This approach eliminates most of the sequencing errors found in the subreads.\nIn this exercise, you will work on a 3.5 Mb contig from an unknown chromosome and tissue. The reads are PacBio HiFi reads, and in this sample, the average read length is approximately 10 kb.

    "text": "HIFI reads. © 2023 PacBio\n\n\n\n\nExercise 32.1.0.1\nGo to the IGV download page and download the program that fits your computer. You should also download the four files found on Brightspace. Once downloaded, you are ready to load the read data in IGV. In the top panel, click ‘Genomes&gt;’Load Genome from file’ and then load the file called ‘contig_1.fasta’. Now you should be able to see that the contig is 3534 kb. Next, click on ‘File&gt;Load from file’ in the top panel and load the file called ‘contig_1.bam’ (if you get something like ‘index error’, ensure that all your files are named correctly, no spaces in the file names and that they are all placed in the same folder). You can zoom in and out in the top right corner of your screen. Zoom in until you see a window size of 23 kb. If you want to go to a specific region, you can change the coordinates in the white box next to the contig name. The format is exactly like the UCSC Genome Browse (chr:start-end). Drag the data track to see different areas on the contig. If you encounter problems, watch this five-minute video. Play around for five minutes to understand what you are looking at.\n\nWhat are the purple ’I’s and the black dots,\nHow does the coverage vary?\nTry to zoom in as much as you can. What information appears in the lower panel?\nClick on one of the reads; what kind of information do you see? Some of the lines are obvious, but some of them are more tricky. Find some of the tags on this page. You should focus on MM, np, rq, clipping, and QV tags:\n\nMM: This tag denotes the probability of a cytosine being methylated when a guanine follows the cytosine. The dinucleotide CG is often referred to as a CpG site. These sites are unique due to their elevated mutation rate, but that topic will be another time.\nNP: The np tag tells you how many times a read is read in the PacBio machine. If a read is read once or twice, it often results in low base qualities. In contrast, if the read is read 15-20 times, we are more confident that the base calls are correct.\nQV: Denotes the quality of the base calling. It ranges from 1-93 on the Phred scale (https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Phred_scale). The tag is highly correlated with the np tag because the more time a read is read, the higher the quality of the base calling.\nRQ: This tag shows the overall quality of the entire read.\nClipping: If a proportion of the read does not fit the reference sequence, that proportion can be masked/clipped. Because of this masking, the read will look shorter in IGV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 32.1.0.2\nGo to: ptg000001l:1003200-1007274. What is the maximum coverage in this region? There is a read with a red arrowhead at the end of the reads. What does that mean (Hint: Look at the tags and compare them to the rest of the reads; one of the tags is different)? How does your conclusion relate to the length of the read that is shown? Right-click on your screen, and you will see a lot of options. Click on ‘Quick consensus mode’. Can you see a difference in some of the reads? You will see two red and green lines on one of the reads. To find out what the lines represent, try to zoom in on these positions and click on each line.\n\nWhat does the colored line represent?\nWhich base is highlighted in green, and which is highlighted in red?\nAs we know, there are four nucleotides. Find out which colors are related to the last two nucleotides (You should zoom out to find these).\nNow go back to ptg000001l:1003200-1007274. You have probably figured out that the colored lines represent a mismatch in the alignment. These mismatches could be rare but true mutations, but they could also be sequencing errors. Use your knowledge about the np tag and QV tag to determine whether the mismatches are due to sequencing errors or true mutations. (Hint: Compare the tags with the reads that do not have mismatches)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 32.1.0.3\nNow that you are an expert in IGV, we are ready for more advanced stuff. Pack your suitcase and travel to ptg000001l:2879315-2879495. Right-click and click on ‘Hide small indels’.\n\nHow many mismatches, insertions, and deletions do you see? You should also include the length of the indels.\nYou might have noticed that some of the reads have turned white. What does the white color mean (Hint: Look at the tags)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 32.1.0.4\nIn one of the previous exercises, you found positions where only one read contained the mismatch. This mismatch is often referred to as a singleton. Base quality (QV) is essential when determining whether the mismatch is a mutation or a sequencing error. In this exercise, you look at another measure called mapping quality (MAPQ). This quality measure ranges from 0 to 60, telling you how unique a read is mapped. If the mapping quality is 0, the read fits equally well in another part of the genome. In this exercise, you will also see what highly frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) look like. Lastly, you will learn to think critically about the coverage and understand how high coverage relates to poor mapping quality.\nGo to ptg000001l:3178259-3178531.\n\nWhat is the maximum coverage in this region, and how does that compare to the values from the previous exercises?\n\nYou should be able to see four SNPs. Click on the colored bars in the coverage panel.\n\nWhat is the count for each nucleotide at the SNP position?\nWhat do the numbers in the parenthesis tell you?\nTry to click on five different reads. What is the MAPQ for each of these reads (write them down)?\nCompare the five values with the MAPQ of five reads found in the previous region (ptg000001l:2879315:2879495). Are they different? Which region do you trust more?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 32.1.0.5\nPlace your cursor on “Color alignments by,” and choose “base modification (5mc)”. What do you see?\nZoom in on one of the blue/red boxes and click some. What do they show you? (Hint: Look at the sequence. Which two bases do you see for all the blue/red colors?)\nGo to ptg000001l:910,755-912,644. You might have noticed that the blue/red color represents the probability of the C being methylated. In this region, you can see that the blue color dominates and that the concentration of CpG sites is high. To see this more clearly, zoom out by clicking the minus button five times. The region looks unique, so let’s investigate it a bit more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 32.1.0.6\nNext to where you put your coordinates, there is a blue square with a red line on it. Click this symbol and move your cursor to the left side of your alignment. Your cursor should look like a “plus” sign. Click on the alignment, then move the cursor to the right side of the screen and click again. The region should now be highlighted by a red line, like in the figure. Click the red line, and click “Copy sequence”. Go to the Bast home page, paste the sequence, and press ‘BLAST’.\n\nWhich chromosome is the sequence from?\nThe sequence aligns 100 % with a gene called KDM5D. Try to explain why it is likely that the blue cluster in IGV represents a gene.\n\n\n\n\nIGV screenshot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 32.1.0.7\nGo to `ptg000001l:1,855,223-1,901,969``. You should see a region with a high number of CpGs, but the base modification differs between the reads. Discuss what causes this pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 32.1.0.8\nIt is time for the grand finale. Go to the end destination, which is found at ptg000001l:243,727-244,325.\n\nDo you think the region contains a gene? Explain why/why not\nHighlight the region, and BLAST the sequence.\nWhich tissue do you think the DNA comes from?\nIf you have time, discover more interesting patterns in the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs",

    "text": "Machine learning comes in many forms. Whether you want to call them artificial intelligence or just models is a matter of taste. Hidden Markov models are one class of models, and neural networks are another.\nAt this point, you already know the basics of neural networks, especially feed-forward networks, and how we can train such a network of sigmoid neurons to work as a classifier. In this exercise, you will play with neural networks and explore how features of input data and hidden layers affect the properties and the neural network’s performance.\nFollow the above link into the Neural Network playground. Start by reading the text below the dashboard and look over the dashboard’s components. At the top, there is a panel with dropdown menus controlling the properties of the network and selecting the type of problem to solve. We will start with an activation type of “TanH” (similar to sigmoid activation) and a problem type of “Classification” (already set if you have not used the site before). You can pick the data set to work on in the “Data” column on the left side. Select the top left one (blue dots surrounded by orange ones), and leave the other controls as they are.\nYou see the network layout in the middle, with the input layer on the left and the output layer on the right. The data is a set of colored points in a two-dimensional coordinate system. The points are split into a training set and a test set. In each epoch of the training, the model parameters are changed, and the resulting change in performance is evaluated by running the model on the test data. The points included in the training data are the ones you see on the right over the output. There is a tick box in the output panel that lets you see the test data too. If you drag the “Data” slider “Ratio of training to test data” to the left, you can see how the training data set shrinks as you include more data in your test set. Leave it at 50%.\nThe neurons in the input layer fire if the data shows a particular feature. In the case of feature X1, the neuron produces output when the data exhibits a gradient of orange points on the left and blue points on the right. Other features trigger the other input neurons, as their thumbnails show.\n\nExercise 33-1\nTrim the network down to a single hidden layer (-1 layer) with just two neurons, and make sure only the X1 feature is selected in the input layer. In the output on the right, the color of each point shows which class it belongs to. The background color represents the classification made by your neural network.\nPress play to start the training. Pay close attention to how the weights and outputs change from their initial states. Run the network for 100-200 epochs, then stop and inspect it.\n\nThe two neurons in the hidden layer should produce output for different features - try hovering over them and think about how the single feature creates these activations.\nDo the weights or the biases differ the most? You can hover over the lines/points or look at their color.\nWhat is the Test Loss noted under output?\nDo you think adding more features, neurons, or layers will improve the classification?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nExample result for the first group of questions\n\nX1 makes a vertical gradient, which means that the neurons have also made a vertical gradient, but it can still isolate the blue points by having vastly different biases. Therefore, the only real difference is the biases.\nTest loss is around 0.26, not that good.\nThe current singular Feature is not enough to distinguish things that are not vertical, neurons/layers will not help here.\nExample result after 700 generations for the second group of questions.\n\nYes, it is around 0.22 now. It does not have to be vertical slices anymore, through the combination of X1 and X2 gradients it can pick any slope for each neuron. As it can now combine two slopes by using two neurons, it works better than the previous model, but still with a lot of incorrect classification.\n\nOnly a single neuron more is needed (three total), as it can now shape a triangle-like shape with its three slopes.\n\nUsing X12 and X22 allows it to form a circle in the middle, so only a single neuron is needed.\n\nThis model has many features and neurons going for it, but it cannot distinguish between left and right nor what is the center, and therefore fails to create a good fit.\n\nMinimal network that I could identify that fit very well with some consistency. It was run multiple times for 500 Epochs, and some of the runs did not perform well. The times it did fit well were usually after 200 Epochs, otherwise, it got stuck in a local minima. Usually, one or more neurons in the last layer look spiral-like - in the above example, neuron 1 and 3 in the second layer has the imprint of a spiral. These are also the neurons that primarily determine the output, as neuron 2 has a much lower weight. Even just removing one feature (such as X22) which seems to be weakly performing makes the network perform much worse.\n\nX1 and X2 are not enough to get a Test Loss under 0.005. It gets close (around 0.01), and the Training loss is quite close to the Test, so we are not overfitting. It is already performing quite well with just eight neurons.\n\nMore layers help some but not that much. More than 2 layers are not needed either, as the neurons in layer 2 are quite similar to the neurons in layer 1, each depicting a slope.\n\nThe other features help a bit more, but all of these improvements are quite marginal.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 33-2\nWe may need more features. Try adding the input node capturing the X2 feature and run this model for 200 epochs.\n\nIs the Test Loss better now (Test Loss is the loss function of the test data).\nThe Output prediction is quite different now; look at the neurons and consider how adding the X2 Feature changed the other neuron outputs.\nIt seems to have quite a different fit - will adding more neurons make it even better?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 33-3\nTwo neurons may not allow for enough flexibility. Add more neurons to the hidden layer and run the model for 200 epochs.\n\nHow many neurons must you add to gain Test Loss under &gt; 0.005?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 33-4\nNow lets see how good you are:\n\nChallenge: How low can you go in total Neurons and Features and still produce a good fit (Test Loss under 0.005)? Consider which features work well with the data especially.\nChallenge: Try creating a model that performs poorly despite having at least three features and four neurons (poorly being Test Loss over 0.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 33-5\nThe ring-shaped classification problem is relatively easy (for neural networks). Now, it is time to challenge it with a more complex problem. Pick the spiral pattern (bottom left option under Data). This pattern is much more complicated, so a Test Loss below 0.05 (rather than 0.005) is good. Using more Features and Neurons will also take longer for each epoch, so you need to be more patient. It also requires more Epochs to train, so wait for 500-1000 Epochs before deciding how well the network performs. While you wait, you can watch the Test Loss graph in the output panel.\n\nTry fitting a model using all features, and decide how many neurons and layers to use. How many neurons do you need to do a good fit? Hint: You may need more than one hidden layer.\nLook at the neurons in the last layer - does any of the neurons reflect the spiral of the data well?\nTry removing some of the features the network uses the least - does it still perform well?\nSummarize the changes you had to make to the network to make it fit the spiral data. Do these changes capture the non-linear pattern in the data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs\n\n\n\n\nExercise 33-6\nLet’s wrap up with a different kind of problem - regression. In contrast to classification, we do not try to predict a discrete class but rather a specific numerical value. At the top left, click on problem type and choose “Regression”. Of the datasets, pick the more difficult dataset to the right, listed as “Multi Gaussian”. Include only the X1 and X2 features, but try different network architectures. Let the training run between 200 and 500 Epochs when testing your network.\n\nCan you get the Test Loss below 0.005 with only a single hidden layer?\nDoes adding more hidden layers improve the model?\nWhich additional features enhance the model the most?\nDoes the addition of some features only improve models with more than one hidden layer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTA note\n\n\n\nSome note for TAs",

Der er muligt at folderens navn indeholder mellemrum. For at navigere ind i en folder der indeholder et mellemrum vha. terminalen, kan man skrive starten af folder-navnet og så trykke på Tab. Så fuldendes navnet automatisk. F.eks.: Hvis folderen hedder “Eksamen Bioinf”, kan man skrive: “cd Eksamen og så trykke Tab. Så fuldendes navnet og man kan trykke Enter.\nSom i programmeringsprojekterne fra kurset skriver du din kode i progexam.py og kører koden sådan her:\npython progexam.py\nSom i programmeringsprojekterne i kurset kan du teste din kode sådan her:\npython test_progexam.py\nTest scriptet er tilgængeligt som en hjælp til at teste din kode, men du har selv det fulde ansvar for rigtigheden af din kode.\nDet er tilladt at bruge løsninger af opgaver til at løse senere opgaver. Man må altså gerne kalde tidligere definerede funktioner inde i andre funktioner, man senere bliver bedt om at skrive.\nFølgende er afgørende for at din eksamensbesvarelse kan evalueres korrekt:\n\nHver funktion skal navngives præcis som angivet i opgaven. Funktioner der ikke er navngivet korrekt, regnes som ikke besvarede.\nDet er ikke tilladt importere kode fra andre filer, du har skrevet eller installeret. Det vil sige, at du ikke må bruge import statements i din fil.\nNår du afleverer progexam.py må den kun indeholde definitioner af de funktioner, der er beskrevet i eksamensopgaven. Al kode udenfor funktionsdefinitioner skal slettes inden du afleverer, så sørg for at teste i god tid inden aflevering, om dine funktioner stadig virker, når du sletter sådan ekstra kode.\n\nAllervigtigst: Funktioner der ikke fuldstænding opfylder opgavens beskrivelse regnes som ikke besvarede. Så sørg for at lave dine funktioner færdige, så de klarer alle tests. Hvis ingen af dine funktioner er helt rigtigt besvaret får du ingen point.",

For eksempel: den variabel der hører til delopgave tre i emne syv hedder emne_7_del_3. Hver variabel har en default værdi som enten er None eller en tom streng (' '):\nemne_7_del_3 = None\nemne_7_del_4 = ' '\n\nDu besvarer sandt/falsk udsagn ved at udskifte None med enten True eller False.\nDu besvarer tal-spørgsmål ved at udskifte None med et tal.\nDu besvarer tekst-opgaver ved at fylde tekst i den tomme streng.\n\nDet er anført i bioinfexam.py om en delopgave skal besvares med True/False, et tal, eller tekst.\nFølgende er afgørende for at din eksamensbesvarelse kan evalueres korrekt: Delopgaver som ikke er besvaret betragtes som forkert besvarede, så du er bedst tjent med at gætte fremfor ikke at svare.\nI nogle af opgaveemnerne refererer statements til en vist illustration.
