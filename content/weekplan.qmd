Make sure you have installed Python and VScode for the first lecture.

##### Lectures:  

- In the first lecture, I will outline how the course is organized and how you will get the most out of your efforts in learning programming.
- In the first lecture, I will also talk about how a Python program works and about values, math, and logic.
- In the second lecture, I will talk about variables, operators, substitution, and reduction.

##### Exercises: 

If you have yet to do so at home, you will install Python and the text editor. To do this, follow the instructions in @sec-before_you_begin. Then, start doing the exercises in chapter @sec-helloworld, chapter @sec-values, and chapter @sec-precedence. You will also have time to do these exercises in the TA session of week two, so go slow. It is important to properly absorb the basic concepts at the beginning of the course; otherwise, it will become too difficult later on. Have a look 

And make sure to familiarize yourself with the Myiagi game and the print-steps tool described in chapter @sec-coursetools. These are useful companions in the course.
